# Fruit Pectin

## For homemade jams, jellies, and similar

---

## Ingredients

* 8 large, tart apples (about 3 pounds), washed and quartered with skin and core intact
* 4 cups water
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice


---

## Steps

1.  In a large pot combine all ingredients, and bring to a boil. Boil for 40 minutes to an hour, stirring occasionally.
2.  Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth. This may take some time depending on how thick the fluid has become.
3.  Boil the pectin and cook until reduced by half, about  20 minutes.
4.  Refrigerate to use within 4 days, or store in the freezer for up to 6 months.

### Notes

* Raspberries are always identified by researchers as low in pectin. But many home jam-makers have found they often behave as though they have high pectin levels. I usually add a small amount of pectin to raspberries, and get a firm set.
* The pectin content in all fruit is also generally higher when fruit is just barely ripe and diminishes as it matures from fully ripe to overripe. The process of ripening involves the breakdown of pectins, which softens the fruit as it ripens. Apples and crabapples (especially unripe ones) are good sources of pectin and are often used in making commercial pectin. Some commercial pectin is made from citrus peels.

Grapes (Eastern Concord)
Lemons
Loganberries
Plums (not Italian)
Quinces
Raspberries (see note above)
Strawberries
