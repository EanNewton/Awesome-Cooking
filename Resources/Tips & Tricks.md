# Tips & Tricks

# Ingredients

## Olive Oil

* Store it in a dark cool place, such as a pantry or cellar. Light and heat are the enemies of good olive oil. You don't want to refrigerate it because it congeals the oil, but it won't hurt it.
* Use it up. It does not improve with age.
* If you buy a large amount, decant it into smaller bottles you can use more easily. Green glass wine bottles are great for keeping out light.
* A combination of olive oil and cider vinegar will keep your wooden counter or cutting board in good shape. I use it often in my own kitchen. Mix 1 part olive oil with 4 parts vinegar. Rub the mixture into the wood, and buff the wood with a dry cloth.

## Rice

* Embarrassed that it took me this long to figure out, so I'll share in case is in the same boat I was. All the videos and recipes I've seen mention to use day old rice, put your rice in the fridge overnight to let it dry out. What none that I've seen mention is to LAY IT OUT FLAT IN A SINGLE LAYER on a baking sheet. I dunno how many times I've taken my day old rice out of the fridge and it's still sticky globs. Laid out flat on the baking sheet leads to perfectly dried individual grains. Finally made a fried rice I was happy with after YEARS of trying. Hope this helps anyone who needs it.

## Cleaning as you go

* Start the day clean. Don't have things piled up to be washed from the day or night before. Get it all done before you go to bed. It really saves time in the long run.
* Keep a large bowl in the sink with hot, soapy water, ready to wash your hands and small utensils.
* Wash your cooking pot right after using it.
* There's an art to washing dishes. The order matters: first glassware, second silverware, then plates and bowls, and finally the large utensils that might need some scrubbing.
    * Dishwasher machines use less water than hand washing.
* Wash with your fingers, not your eyes. But then, in a different light, holding the article up to check if it is truly clean never hurts.
* Never leave your knife out on the counter. Use it, wash it, wipe it dry, and put it away. Your knives will stay sharper if you do this.
* Do leave things out to dry; air drying is more sanitary than towel drying. But use a clean towel for the good stemware and silver to avoid water spots.
* Constantly wiping down your work area saves a lot of hard cleaning later.
