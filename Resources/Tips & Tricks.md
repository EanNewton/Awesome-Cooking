## Rice

* Embarrassed that it took me this long to figure out, so I'll share in case is in the same boat I was. All the videos and recipes I've seen mention to use day old rice, put your rice in the fridge overnight to let it dry out. What none that I've seen mention is to LAY IT OUT FLAT IN A SINGLE LAYER on a baking sheet. I dunno how many times I've taken my day old rice out of the fridge and it's still sticky globs. Laid out flat on the baking sheet leads to perfectly dried individual grains. Finally made a fried rice I was happy with after YEARS of trying. Hope this helps anyone who needs it.
