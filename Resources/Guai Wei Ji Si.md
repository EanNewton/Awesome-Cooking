## Chinese, "odd flavor sauce" 

---

## Ingredients

* About 1 pound cooked chicken meat, cooled
* 6 to 8 scallions, white parts only
* 1 tablespoon white sugar
* Salt to taste
* 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon Chinkiang or black Chinese vinegar
* 3 tablespoons well-blended Chinese sesame paste (or tahini)
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 2 tablespoons chili oil with chile flakes
* 1 teaspoon ground roasted Sichuan pepper
* 3 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds

## Steps

1.  Cut the chicken, with any remaining skin, into slivers, about Â½ inch wide. If you want to be really authentic, hit it a few times with a rolling pin to loosen the fibers and then tear the flesh into shreds by hand.
2.  Cut the scallions into sections and then slice these lengthwise into fine slivers. Put them into a bowl of cold water to refresh.
3.  Stir the sugar and salt into the soy sauce sauce and vinegar until dissolved. Gradually stir in the sesame paste to make a smooth sauce. Add the other ingredients except the sesame seeds and mix well.
4.  Shortly before serving, drain the scallions and pile them neatly in the center of your serving dish. Lay the chicken slivers on top of them. Pour over the prepared sauce.
5.  At the last minute, sprinkle with the sesame seeds.

## Notes

It is named "Odd Flavor Sauce" but I promise it is not odd and is totally delicious.
