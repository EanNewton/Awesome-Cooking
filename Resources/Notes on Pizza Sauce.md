# Notes on Pizza Sauce

## Tomatoes
You want to start with the best tasting crushed tomato you can find. Everything hinges on the tomato. No ingredient - no amount of doctoring, will ever be able to compensate for a subpar tomato. It is has to be crushed or ground. Crushed tomatoes are made with riper tomatoes, due to the fact that, in order to be able to peel a whole tomato, it can't be quite so ripe, so the riper tomatoes get sorted out and crushed. Here are the brands that pizza obsessives tend to prefer (from most preferred to least.)

1. Sclafani - Don Pepino brand, not Gus Sclafani of CT. My favorite. Bright red. Sweet, bright tasting and very robust. NJ grown. Regional availability.
2. Jersey Fresh - Almost identical to Sclafani. Regional availability.
3. Escalon 6 in 1 Ground Tomatoes - Wholesale only. Californian. One of the two most common brands used by pizzerias, the other being Stanislaus
4. Stanislaus 7/11 (or Tomato Magic) - Wholesale only. Californian.
5. Classico Crushed Tomatoes - Possibly the same as Escalon 6 in 1s. Californian grown. National availability, but can be hard to find. Pastene - Not quite as good as Sclafani (not quite as ripe, an odd green piece). Better availability than Sclafani, but may not be national.

There's a really good chance that, as you look at the tomatoes your local supermarket offers, you might not find any on this list.

Some can be mail ordered, but the shipping is cost prohibitive, and the cans typically get pretty banged around by careless delivery people. Your best bet it to look at the crushed/ground brands you do have access to, google them to get people's opinion of them, buy an assortment and do a side by side taste test to see which one you like the best.

Once you've found a good tasting tomato, you're all set. You'll generally want to hand blend them very lightly to break them down just a bit, but don't overdo it. The membranes in tomatoes trap liquid, so the more you break them down, the more liquid you release, risking a sauce that is too watery. You can take your lightly hand blended tomato, add some salt, maybe a little sugar and use it like that (which a lot of places do), or you can start adding ingredients.

As you add ingredients, it's absolutely critical that you remember that it's all about the tomato. Everything should supplement the tomato flour, never overshadow it.

## Salt
Salt should always be added to taste, and always added carefully. Generally speaking, a good tomato sauce should be a bit under-salted, so that, when combined with the salty cheese and salty toppings (like pepperoni), it's not too much salt. Many canned tomatoes have salt already added, so, while most of them require a bit more salt, it's typically not much.

## Oregano
Oregano is probably the most common herb/spice in NY style pizza. You'll either find it in the sauce or sprinkled on top of the pie. I find it disperses a bit better in the sauce.

## Basil
First of all, never use dried basil - it's a completely different flavor than fresh and has no place in pizza. Fresh basil is a bit less common in NY pizza than oregano. Some places put leaves on top of the pies, either before or after baking, but, if you put a plain slice next to a slice with visible leaves, I'm reasonably certain that 7 out of 10 people will grab the plain slice. If you chop up a little basil very finely, though, and add it the sauce, you can add some wonderful tomato augmenting basil flavor without alienating anyone who might avoid anything visibly green on a pizza.

## Garlic
Garlic, like basil and oregano, helps to round out the flavor of a sauce and add some complexity. Much like basil, though, if it's noticeable, some people will love it, while others will hate it.

## Sugar
Very rarely, you'll find tomatoes that are sweet enough on their own. Sugar is generally a given, but be careful. The magic all hinges on that perfect balance between sweetness and acidity. Too much sugar, and the brightness, the freshness, is gone, too little and the acidic punch of the tomatoes clashes with the rest of the pie. Adding sugar to tomatoes is probably going to be one of the most difficult things you do making sauce. While some brands of tomatoes tend to very consistent, you're never going to get exactly the same level of sweetness from can to can. You also have to allow for the slight sweetening that occurs to the tomatoes during baking.
