## Hors d'Oeuvre

### Endive, Pear, & Truffle Honey Tartine

#### Ingredients

* 4 very thin slices pumpernickle raisin bread
* EVOO for drizzling
* Head Belgian endive, leaves separated
* 1 ripe pear, thinly sliced
* 8 oz / 220 g Gorgonzola dolce, or other soft blue cheese, cut into thin slivers
* Truffle honey or raw honey and truffle oil for drizzling
* Toasted hazelnuts

---

#### Steps

1.  Toast the bread until crisp. Place the toasted bread on a work surface and drizzle lightly with olive oil. Top with and endive leaf, sliced pear, and cheese, dividing them equally. Drizzle with truffle honey and top with nuts. Serve immediately.

### Pumpernickle Bread

#### Ingredients

* 480 g all purpose flour
* 96 g pumpernickle (rye) flour
* 21 g rye bread improver (optional)
* 11 g black cocoa, for dark pumpernickle color
* 1 tsp deli rye flavor (optional)
* 14 g salt
* 2 tsp instant yeast
* 425 g water, lukewarm

---

#### Steps

1. Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine all of the ingredients and mix and knead — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until the dough is elastic and slightly sticky.
3. Let the dough rise in a lightly greased, covered bowl for 1 to 2 hours; it should become puffy.
5. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled surface. Gently deflate it, and shape it into a ball.
7. Place the shaped loaf onto a lightly-greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or into a round lidded stoneware baker (our cloche is a good option here) and cover with the lid.
10. Let the loaf rise for 60 to 90 minutes, until it's almost doubled in size.
12. Preheat the oven to 425°F.
14. Slash the loaf diagonally in several places.
16. Bake the loaf for 35 to 45 minutes until it is crusty, and a digital thermometer inserted into the center reads 190°F to 200°F. If using a stoneware baker, remove the lid for the final 5 minutes of baking for a crusty top.
18. Remove the bread from the oven, and transfer it to a rack to cool completely.

## Soup

### Creamed Corn, Fig Jam, & Dried Vanilla Pod
#### Ingredients

##### creamed corn
* 4 cups corn kernels
* 2 cups Corn Cob Stock
* salt

##### to serve
* 1 scraped vanilla pod
* 4 tbsp Fig, Pepper Skin & Riesling Jam

---

#### Steps

1.  In a medium saucepot, combine the corn kernels and stock with a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce to medium-low and cook at a simmer, uncovered, until the kernels are completely tender, 20-25 minutes. Remove from the heat. Transfer half of the corn to a blender and puree until smooth. Return the blended corn to the pot and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed.
2.  Dry the vanilla pod in a dehydrator for 6-8 hours at 135 F, or until completely dry. Break the pod up with your hands and grind in a coffee grinder to a fine powder. Store, indefinitely, at room temp in an airtight container.
3.  Divide the corn across 4 bowl and top with a quenelle or dollop of jam. Finish with ground vanilla pod.

### Corn Cob Stock
#### Ingredients

* 8 corn cobs, cut into thirds (cob only, no kernels needed)
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt

---

#### Steps

1. In a medium stockpot, combine the cobs, salt, and 2 quarts (about 2 liters) water. Bring to a bare simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and keep just below a simmer for 1 hour 30 minutes.
2. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve into airtight containers (discard the corn cobs). Refrigerate for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 3 months.

### Fig Jam
#### Ingredients

* 2 1/2 lb / 1 kg fresh figs, stemmed and quartered
* a generous 1 cup / 260 ml Riesling wine
* 1/4 cup / 50 g granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup / 60 g finely chopped, charred red bell pepper skins (see: 309)
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt

---

#### Steps

1. In a large saucepot, combine the figs, Riesling, sugar, pepper skins, and salt. Cook over medium heat, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the wine is cooked out and the figs are very soft, 25 to 30 minutes.
2. Run the jam through a food mill, then transfer to a baking sheet or any flat surface. Cool to room temperature, then transfer to an airtight container. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 weeks.

### Roasted Red Peppers & Tears
#### Ingredients

* 5 lb / 2.25 kg red bell peppers

---

#### Steps

1. Char the peppers over an open flame - on a grill or directly over the gas burner on your stove -- until they are blackened all over, using tongs to move them around.
2. Transfer the peppers to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap -- the steam will make the peppers easier to peel when cool.
3. Once the peppers are cool enough to handle, carefully peel, stem, and seed the peppers over a bowl, being careful to reserve all of the juices ("tears"). Discard the stems and seeds (and reserve the charred skins for Fig, Pepper Skin and Riesling Jam (see: 268)). Use immediately or refrigerate (in separate airtight containers) for up to 1 week

---

## Appetizer

### Daikon Braised in Orange Juice

#### Ingredients

* 1 very large daikon radish (Or, jicama or white turnip), cut into slices 1/2 to 3/4 inch
* 2 1/2 cup strained fresh orange juice
* 2 tsp kosher salt

---

#### Steps

1.  In a pan at least 12 inches wide, combine the daikon, oj, and salt in a single layer. Set the pan over medium heat and cook the daikon until the oj evaporates below the surface of the daikon. Carefully flip the slices - they should be fairly soft at this point, and easily damaged if you're not careful.
2.  As the daikon continues to cook, gradually baste it with the reducing oj until the daikon is quite tender but still holding together well. It will be around 35-40 minutes of total cooking time.

### Limoncello Gin Collins Cocktail
#### Ingredients

* 2 oz limoncello
* 1.5 oz gin
* 1.5 oz lemon juice
* 1 oz mint simple syrup
* 2 oz club soda
* sprig of fresh mint and lemon wheel, for garnish

---

#### Steps

1.  Shake limoncello, gin, lemon juice, and mint simply syrup with ice. Pour.
2.  Top with club soda. Stir gently with a bar spoon and garnish.

### Limoncello
#### Ingredients

* 7 citrus fruits (I recommend lemon, blood or sour orange, bergamot, mandarin, yuzu; you need 1 fruit for every 75 ml / 5 tbsp of alcohol, 2 if they are particularly small)
* 500 ml / 2 cup plus 2 tbsp vodka or white rum
* 400 g granulated sugar
* 400 ml / 1 3/4 cup filtered water

---

#### Steps

1.  Zest the fruit, either with a microplane or in strips with a swivel peeler. Put in a sealed glass container with the vodka or rum. Leave to infuse at room temperature for several days, or up to 3 weeks. The rule of thumb is that no more flavour is to be had once the zest has turned white, but this isn't exact. I find 5-7 days will give quite a pronounced flavor, making this a very useful recipe if you want fast results.
2.  Make a sugar syrup. Put the sugar and water in a saucepan. Heat gently, stirring constantly until the sugar has dissolved, then leave to simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool.
3.  Start mixing the sugar syrup and infused alcohol. I start with the same amount of syrup to alcohol, mixing thoroughly and tasting. Add more sugar syrup until you are happy with the flavour — the more you add, the smoother and sweeter your cello will become.
4.  Decant into a jug and pour into sterilized bottles.

## Salad

### Cranberry-Avocado Salad with White Balsamic Vinaigrette
#### Ingredients

##### For the dressing:

* ⅓ cup sugar
* 1 ½ tablespoons poppy seeds
* 1 ½ tablespoons sesame seeds
* ½ teaspoon paprika
* 2 teaspoons dried mustard
* 1 tablespoon minced sweet onion
* ½ teaspoon sea salt
* ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* ½ cup white balsamic vinegar
* ⅓ cup vegetable oil
* ⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil

##### For the salad:

* 12 ounces baby spinach, arugula, field greens
* 1 small bunch cilantro washed and dried, leaves removed whole from stems
* 2 medium avocados peeled and halved
* ¾ cup dried cranberries
* ¾ cup Candied Spiced Almonds

---

#### Steps

1.  For the dressing, combine all ingredients in a pint sized glass jar and shake well to dissolve sugar.
2.  For the salad, place greens and cilantro leaves in a large bowl. Add avocado and dried cranberries and about 1/4 cup of the dressing and toss gently. Scatter candied almonds over salad and sprinkle lightly with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pass extra dressing at the table.

## Main

### Peas, White Chocolate, & Macadamia Nuts
#### Ingredients

* 2 lb shucked peas
* 2 tbsp evoo
* 2 tsp fresh lemon juice
* 3/4 cup Pea Shell Stock, chilled
* 1 tbsp champagne vinegar
* 3 tbsp chopped white chocolate
* 3 tbsp chopped and toasted macadamia nuts
* chocolate mint or spearmint leaves, to garnish
* pea tendrils and blossoms, to garnish

---

#### Steps

1.  Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over medium high heat. Prepare an ice bath. Add the peas to the boiling water and blanch until tender but not too soft, about 2 minutes. Drain and immediately chill in ice bath, allow to dry on a tea towel.
2.  Gently squeeze each pea to remove the two halves inside the skin and transfer to a bowl. Season with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt to taste.
3.  Combine the pea shell stock and champagne vinegar and season to taste.
4.  To serve, divide the peas across 6 bowls. Top with the white chocolate and macadamia nuts. Garnish with mint leaves, pea tendrils, and blossoms. At the table, pour over the pea shell stock and garnish with dots of olive oil.

### Pea Shell Stock
#### Ingredients

* 1 lb / 455 g shucked pea pods (from about 2 lb whole pods)
* 2 sprigs fresh spearmint
* 1 garlic clove, smashed, germ removed
* 1 shallot, sliced

---

#### Steps

1. Wrap the pea pods, mint sprigs, garlic, and shallot in cheesecloth, then tie it up with twine into a bundle.
2. In a pot, combine 1 quart / 1 liter water and the sachet. Set the pot over low heat, but don't let the stock bubble or the drab color of the pods will start to bleed into the stock -- you want to steep the sachet to clear a broth.
3. After 2 hours, remove the sachet, allow it to drain back into the pot for a moment, then discard. Transfer the stock to an airtight container, cover, and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 2 months.

## Palate Cleanser

### Gin and Bitter Grapefruit Granita
#### Ingredients

* Finely grated zest and juice of 1 grapefruit (yellow or pink)
* A few springs of mint (grapefruit mint if you have it, spearmint otherwise)
* 125 g granulated sugar
* 250 ml / 1 cup water
* 250 ml / 1 cup tonic water
* 50 ml / 3 1/2 tbsp gin
* Grapefruit bitters, to serve (optional)

---

#### Steps

1.  Put the grapefruit zest, mint and sugar into a saucepan with the water. Stir over a gentle heat until the sugar dissolved then turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat immediately, then add the tonic water, gin and grapefruit juice. Leave to cool to room temperature, then chill in the refrigerator.
2.  Strain the liquid into a lidded freezer-proof box. You need it to be fairly wide, so the granita is quite shallow, about 2-3 cm deep. Freeze for an hour, or until a layer of ice has formed around the edge of the granita. Scrape this off with a fork and beat into the rest of the mixture. Repeat with a fork and beat into the rest of the mixture. Repeat this every 30 minutes, until you have a granita formed of ice crystals. Leave in the freezer until you are ready to eat, but if you are leaving it for any length of time, you are going to need to break it up fairly regularly. Serve in small glasses, with a dash of grapefruit bitters, if you like.

## Second Main

### Brassicas a la Catalan

#### Ingredients

* 1 lb florets from assorted brassicas, specifically broccoli and cauliflower, such as Romanesco, or any other cool types you can find
* 2 tbsp evoo
* salt
* 1/4 cup pine nut pudding
* 2 tbsp golden raisins
* 1 tbsp toasted pine nuts
* 20 small peppermint leaves
* 1/2 cup pepper tears, at room temp

---

#### Steps

1.  Follow the trimming instructions for the brassicas. Everything should be in bite-size pieces.
2.  In a bowl, toss the brassicas with the olive oil. Season pretty aggressively with salt, as this is the only salt added to the dish.
3.  To serve, spoon the pine nut pudding on one side of each of 4 bowls and lay down the dressed brassicas on top. Sprinkle with the raisins and pine nuts on top, followed by mint leaves. Finally, gently pour the pepper tears on the opposite side of the bowl from the pine nut pudding.

### Pine Nut Pudding
#### Ingredients

* 3 ounces / 85 g raw pine nuts
* 1/2 cup / 120 ml whole milk or soy milk
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
* 2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

---

#### Steps

1. Preheat an oven to 300 F / 150 C
2. Spread the pine nuts in a baking sheet and roast, stirring occasionally, until intense golden brown in color and aromatic, about 20 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, in a pot with a metal bowl fitted snugly on top, bring a few inches of water to a simmer over low heat.
4. Transfer the toasted pine nuts to the bowl and add the milk and salt. Wrap the top of the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the mixture steep over the simmering water for 30 minutes.
5. Transfer the nut-milk mixture to a blender and start to puree. With the blender motor running, slowly pour in the olive oil in a steady stream. The pudding should have a mousse-like consistency; if it seems too stiff, add more olive oil. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
6. Pour the pudding into a bowl and place plastic wrap directly over the surface. If the plastic does not have direct contact, the pudding will form a skin, which you don't want in a smooth puree like this. Set the puddings aside to cool to room temperature, then transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 to 5 days.

## Dessert

### Strawberry Pavlova, Yogurt, & Black Pepper
#### Ingredients

##### dehydrated strawberry powder
* 9 ounces (255 g) strawberries, hulled

##### meringues
* 1 1/4 cup (280 g) superfine sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch
* 1/2 cup (120 ml) egg whites, from about 4-5 large eggs
* 1/8 tsp cream of tartar
* 1/8 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

##### macerated strawberries
* 1 lb (455 g) strawberries, hulled and roughly chopped
* 1 tbsp granulated sugar
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1/4 tsp rosewater

##### yogurt cream
* 1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream
* 1 cup (240 ml) yogurt


---

#### Steps

##### dehydrated strawberry powder
1. Arrange the strawberries on dehydrator trays and dehydrate at 135 F / 57 C for 12 to 16 hours, until completely dehydrated. Transfer to a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle and grind to a fine powder.

##### meringues
1. Preheat the oven to 225 F / 110 C
2. In a bowl combine the superfine sugar and cornstarch and mix well. Set aside.
3. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt on low speed. Increase the speed to medium and whisk until the mixture becomes frothy, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Add the sugar and cornstarch mixture in three equal parts -- it's okay if the sugar doesn't quite dissolve all the way right now -- and continue to whisk until the egg whites start to form peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the vanilla and vinegar and continue whisking until stiff peaks form, another 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the mixer off.
5. Line an 18 x 13 inch baking sheet with parchment or silicone baking mat. Using a 3 oz (45 ml) ice cream scoop, form 6 individual meringues on the lined pan. Bake for 1 hour, rotating the pan every 15 minutes. Then reduce the oven temperature to 200 F (95 C) and bake for 1 more hour (you don't need to rotate anymore). When the meringues are done, they should peel off easily from the parchment and have a hard exterior with a soft interior. Let the meringues cool to room temperature.

##### macerated strawberries
1. In a bowl, combine the strawberries, granulated sugar, salt, pepper, and rosewater and toss to combine. Set aside for at least 30 minutes and refrigerate until ready to serve.

##### yogurt cream
1. In a bowl, whip the cream to stiff peaks and fold in the yogurt until combined. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

##### to serve
1. To serve, slice through the meringues horizontally, like splitting a burger bun. Place a bottom piece on each plate and spoon the yogurt cream onto it. Add macerated strawberries, then drizzle some of the juices over them. Place the top of the meringue over the strawberries. With a fine-mesh sieve, sift the dehydrated strawberry powder over the Pavlova.

### London Fog Tea

#### Ingredients
* 1 cup Earl Grey tea
* 1 cup steamed whole milk
* 0.5 to 1 oz vanilla simple syrup
* White chocolate sauce, to drizzle

#### Steps
1. Pour the vanilla syrup, tea, and steamed milk. Drizzle with chocolate sauce.

## Mignardise

### Chewy Citrus Caramels

#### Ingredients

* 100 g / 7 tbsp butter, plus extra, softened, for greasing
* 300 ml / 1 3/4 cups heavy cream
* Strips of pared zest from 1 large or 2 small citrus fruits
* 1/2 vanilla pod
* A piece of a cinnamon stick (optional)
* A few allspice berries, lightly crushed (optional)
* A few cardamom pods (optional)
* A pinch of salt
* 200 g granulated sugar
* 150 g / 7 tbsp golden syrup
* 50 ml / 3 1/2 tbsp water

---

#### Steps

1.  Butter a square 20 cm baking tin and line with plastic wrap, making sure it overlaps the sides so the caramel will be easy to remove.
2.  Put the cream in a saucepan with the zest, vanilla and any other aromatic you are using, if any. Heat gently until just below boiling point, then remove from the heat and leave to infuse until quite cool. If you can, leave for an hour or so, or even overnight.
3.  Reheat the cream, this time with the butter and salt added to it. When the butter has melted, remove from the heat and strain into a jug.
4.  Put the sugar and golden syrup in a saucepan with the water. Do not stir. Leave on a medium to high heat until it has melted into a light golden syrup. When it starts to boil rapidly, add your sugar thermometer — it will not take long to get up to 127 C / 260 F and should turn very slightly darker.
5.  Remove from the heat. Gradually pour the cream mixture into the sugar mixture, whisking constantly. Return the saucepan to a medium-high heat and bring back to a boil, again without stirring. It will foam up and will look somewhere between a frothy banana or butterscotch milkshake. Continue to heat, stirring regularly with a rubber spatula, until the thermometer reads around 130-133 C / 266-271 F; this will take a few minutes. When it reaches this temperature, remove from the heat and start whisking with a balloon whisk — keep whisking until the caramel is very smooth and all the bubbles have subsided. Pour into the prepared tin — it will be liquid enough to form a smooth, even layer. Drop it a couple of times onto the work surface just to remove any air bubbles.
6.  Leave to set for several hours or overnight, then cut into squares with a sharp knife, either sprayed with quick-release spray or heated up under a flame. Wrap each in wax paper and twist. How many you get depends on size — I normally cut it into 8 x 8, giving 64 pieces.

### Miso Butterscotch

---
#### Ingredients

* ¾ cup cream
* 6 tablespoons (¾ stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces
* ¼ cup miso (red miso is a bit salty for truly sweet applications)
* ¾ cup brown sugar

---

#### Steps

1. Combine the cream and butter in a small saucepan, and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter melts.
2. Stir in the miso and sugar and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture is slightly thickened and shiny, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and add a little more sugar if you think it's too salty (remember, you'll be using it in savory dishes).
3. Use right away or refrigerate, well covered, for up to 1 week and rewarm before using to loosen it up.

### Brown Butter Solids

#### Ingredients

* 150 grams butter, salted
* 50 grams nonfat dry milk powder


---

#### Steps

1.  In a pot, bring butter to a boil over medium-high heat.
2.  Whisking continuously, add dry milk. Cook until golden brown. The color will continue to darken.
3.  Place a strainer over a jar to separate the liquid from the solids. Reserve brown butter liquids for another use. Allow solids to cool on a paper towel lined sheet, store in an airtight container with a desiccant pack.

---

### Black Orange Cocktail

* 1 shot Orange & Coffee Liqueur
* 1 shot espresso
* 2 shots vodka
* Twist of orange

Shake over ice.

### Orange and Coffee Liqueur

#### Ingredients

* 2 Seville oranges
* 44 (6 g / 1 heaped tbsp) medium roast coffee beans
* 44 tsp (250 g) sugar 
* 1 litre / 4 cups golden rum

---

#### Steps

1.  Wash and dry the oranges thoroughly. Cut slits evenly over the orange skin and push the coffee beans in. Put in a large preserving jar and cover with the sugar. Pour over the rum and seal.
2.  Leave to steep for 44 days (6 weeks) then strain into clean, sterilized bottles. Do not leave this for longer as I did the first time I made it — the bitter notes will become too dominant.
