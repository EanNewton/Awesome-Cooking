---

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 400.
2. Rub the cut sides of the squash with olive oil and place the squash cut side down on a baking sheet. Roast until very soft, about 1 hour. Let stand until cool enough to handle.
3. Meanwhile, put the amaretto in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until the liquid is reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool completely.
4. With a large spoon, scoop the squash flesh into a large bowl. Let cool completely.
5. Fold the reduced amaretto and mascarpone into the squash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper and refrigerate until ready to use.
