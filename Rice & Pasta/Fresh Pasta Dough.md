---

## Ingredients

* 2 ½ cups Italian 00 pasta flour, or all purpose flour
* 1 large egg
* 3 large egg yolks
* ½ cup water
* Semolina flour for dusting

---

## Steps

1.  Mound 2 cups of the pasta flour on a work surface and make a deep well in the center. In a small bowl, whisk the egg, yolks and water together until combined and pour it into the well. Using a fork, whisk the eggs around the edges, gradually incorporating the flour. When the mixture becomes too stiff to stir, knead it until it forms a dough. Knead the remaining ½ cup flour into the dough and continue kneading until it is very soft and smooth, 6 to 8 minutes. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.
2. Cut the dough into 6 pieces and dust them lightly with pasta flour. Working with one piece at a time flatten with a pasta machine or rolling pin. Cut to shape. Wrap in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
