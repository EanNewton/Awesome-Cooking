## Steps

1.  In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil or butter over low heat. If using butter, stir it occasionally until melted.
2. Add the rice and lime juice and stir for 1 minute. Add the water and salt. Raise the heat and bring to a boil.
3. Cover, turn down the heat to low, and simmer until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed, about 25 minutes. Do not uncover early and allow to rest, covered, for 10 minutes after removing from the heat.
4. Fluff the rice with a fork and stir in the cilantro.
