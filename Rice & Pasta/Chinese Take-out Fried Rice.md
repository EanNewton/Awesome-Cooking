## Steps

1.  If using day-old rice, transfer to a medium bowl and break the rice up with your hands into individual grains before proceeding. Heat 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large wok over high heat until smoking. Add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until the rice is pale brown, toasted, and has a lightly chewy texture, about three minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon oil and remaining rice.
2. Return all the rice to the wok and press it up the sides, leaving a space in the middle. Add 1/2 tablespoon oil to the space. Add onion, carrot, scallions, and garlic and cook, stirring gently, until lightly softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Toss with rice to combine. Add soy sauce and sesame oil and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and white pepper.
3. Push rice to the side of the wok and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil. Break the egg into the oil and season with a little salt. Use a spatula to scramble the egg, breaking it up into small bits. Toss the egg and the rice together.
4. Add frozen peas and continue to toss and stir until peas are thawed and every grain of rice is separate. Serve immediately.

## Notes
* For the best results, use Chinese-style medium grain rice, jasmine rice, or sushi rice. Rice should either be cooked fresh, spread on a tray, and allowed to cool for five minutes, or alternatively transferred to a loosely covered container and refrigerated for at least 12 hours and up to three days.
* Frying in batches compensates for the low heat output of Western stovetops.
* Keeping the seasoning very light allows the flavor of the rice and aromatics to come through.
* Starting with freshly cooked or well-chilled rice guarantees it won't clump up as you stir-fry it.
