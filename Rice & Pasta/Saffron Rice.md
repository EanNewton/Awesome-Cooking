## Steps

1.  Pour 1/4 cup of hot water into the mortar. Let the saffron soak for 5 minutes. This will open up the flavor of the spice.
2. In a large heavy pot, heat extra virgin olive oil over medium. Add the minced onion to the pot and saute for about 10 minutes, till the onion begins to caramelize.
3. Add rice to the pot and saute for one minute longer, mixing the rice together with the cooked onion.
4. Add the saffron liquid, broth, and salt to the pot. Bring to a boil.
5. Cover the pot and reduce heat to low. Allow to steam for 20 minutes, then remove from heat and allow to rest for 15 minutes, do not open the lid during this time.
6. Uncover and fluff with a fork.
