## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2. Place the gnocchi in salted, boiling water and cook until they’ve floated to the surface for a couple of minutes.
3. Drain and place gnocchi in a single-layer in a 1-1/2 quart shallow baking dish that has been sprayed with nonstick spray.
4. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
5. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
6. Whisk in flour until it thickens and bubbles, then whisk in milk and dijon.
7. Continue to whisk mixture and cook until slightly thickened, about 3-5 minutes.
8. Combine the gruyere and fontina, and then add the cheese by the handful to milk mixture, stirring until melted before adding more.
9. Once all the cheese is melted, taste the sauce and season it with salt and pepper.
10. Pour sauce evenly over the gnocchi.
11. In a small bowl, combine the parmesan and panko – then, sprinkle the mixture evenly on top of the gnocchi.
12. Bake the gnocchi until they puff and the cheese is golden and bubbly, about 25 minutes.
13. Let the gnocchi rest for 5 minutes before serving.
