## Steps

1.  Cut off half the length of the stems of the gotu kola bunch and set aside. You can use these to make gotu kola kanda.
2.  Discard any spoilt leaves and wash the gota kola thoroughly. Taking a handful of the washed leaves with stems at a time, cut the gotu kola very finely. Put it in a medium bowl.
3.  Add the coconut, onion, chili, tomato, Maldive fish, pepper, lime juice, and salt. Mix well and serve.
