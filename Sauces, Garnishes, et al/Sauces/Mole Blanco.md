## Steps

1.  In a pan on a medium heat, roast the almonds, peanuts, pine nuts and sesame seeds until lightly golden and fragrant. Set aside.
2.  Roast the chilies on a griddle, then place them in a plastic bag to sweat. (Important: roast the chilies raw)
3.  Clean the peppers, removing skin, seeds and stem. Mince them.
4.  Blend the chilies with the chicken stock. Set aside.
5.  Heat the butter in a large saucepan on a medium heat. Cook plantain until golden. Add onion and raw garlic and more butter if needed. Cook until onions are transparent.
6.  Incorporate the almonds, peanuts, pine nuts, raisins and bread.
7.  Cook until bread is soft and blended with the onion mixture.
8.  Season with salt and white pepper to taste. Add spices, stock, white chocolate and roasted garlic (if using) and keep cooking on a medium-low heat for a minimum 15-20 minutes.
9.  Use an immersion blender and blend to a smooth sauce in the saucepan.
10.  To serve, cover chicken pieces with the sauce and sprinkle on toasted sesame seeds.
11.  Serve garnished with edible flowers to taste.

## Notes

The most traditional way to serve it, he told me, is with an edible flower known as pípí or chitapí in Mixtec that comes from a tree and tastes like green beans. Unsurprisingly, they have been unable to find it here. Other acceptable avenues for the sauce include rabbit, various fowl, and chiles rellenos.
