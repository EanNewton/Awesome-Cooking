# New York Style Pizza Sauce

---

## Ingredients

* 28 oz Sclafani crushed tomatoes (use water to clean out can)
* 2 oz water
* 1.5 very small basil leaves- very finely chopped
* 0.5 tsp salt
* 1 scant dash (1/8 t.) oregano (measured then crushed in the palm of the hand)
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 very small clove garlic (about the size of a pinky fingernail) pressed

## Steps

1.  Hand blend the tomatoes and then mix in everything else and let sit for at least an hour for the flavors to develop.
2.  This is both for Sclafani AND it's for a particular can of Sclafani. If you just print this out and use it for other cans/other brands, without really understanding the overall philosophy, the sauce will suffer.
3.  Remember, if in doubt, use less, or even none at all. A good can of crushed tomatoes, with nothing added, will make a better sauce than adding too much of any particular ingredient.

## Notes

* My NY style sauce recipe is more of a philosophy than a recipe. While there's some personal preference involved, it predominantly reflects my analysis of the last 40 years of New York area pizza- with a heavy emphasis on successful (award winning/money making) approaches. In other words, I've tried to look at the most successful places in my area of the last few decades, find common threads between them, and try to distill that knowledge into the most crowd pleasing and authentic approach possible.
* It's not about "I like garlic" or "I don't like garlic" or any other particular ingredient. It's about making a sauce that, if done well, 99 out of 100 people are going to enjoy.
* The ingredients in NY style pizza sauce are as equally important as the ingredients that AREN'T in pizza sauce. Vinegar, lemon juice, thyme, marjoram, any form of alcohol, tomato paste, olive oil - you won't find any self respecting pizzeria owner adding any of these. And it should go without saying that NY style sauce should NEVER EVER be cooked.
