* One 28-ounce can San Marzano tomatoes in juice, crushed with your hands

## Steps

1.  Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until soft and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to deepen in color and caramelize, about 3 minutes. Add the brown sugar and continue cooking, stirring often, for another 5 minutes.
2.  Add the vinegar, tomatoes, soy sauce, salt, chile powder, mustard, cloves, and allspice and stir well to combine. Cover the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches a thick, ketchup-like consistency, about 30 minutes.
3.  Transfer the mixture to a blender and puree until smooth. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl and pass the ketchup through it, pressing on the solids with a rubber spatula or a spoon to push through any large pieces. Let cool completely. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
