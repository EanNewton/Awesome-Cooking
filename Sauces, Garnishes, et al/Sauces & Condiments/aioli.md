makes 1 cup (240 ml)

* 1 cup (240 ml) olive oil (preferably in a squeeze bottle)
* a small dish of tepid water (if needed)

## Steps

1.  Start by grinding the salt and garlic in a mortar and pestle. Salt is abrasive and will help break the garlic down.
2.  Start working the yolks in with the garlic and salt. Once they are well combined, start with a few droplets of olive oil. Aioli is delicate stuff and cannot be rushed. Keep working the sauce, adding a few drops at a time. As you get further along in the process you can begin adding a little bit more olive oil each time -- just don't go too crazy. Once you're about halfway through, you can switch to a whisk in your mortar if you like.
3.  Keep going until all of the olive oil is used up. It should look like custard when it is finished, able to form in thick dollops that do not run. It does not need to hold stiff peaks, but should still hold shape and have a luxurious mouthfeel. It is too thick if it will be bouncy like panna cotta with too much gelatin. If it is getting too thick or pasty, add a drop or two of tepid water (and only a drop or two because too much water will kill the mousse-like consistency you're looking for).
