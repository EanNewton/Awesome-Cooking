# Quick Hollandaise

---

## Ingredients

* 1 egg yolk
* 1 to 2 teaspoons lemon juice, about 1 whole large lemon juiced
* 1 teaspoon water or cream
* Dash of paprika (optional)
* Pinch of salt
* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter


---

## Steps

1.  In a blender combine egg yolk, lemon juice, water or cream, paprika and salt for a few seconds until thoroughly mixed.
2.  Chop butter into 3 or 4 pieces, place in a microwave safe cup and microwave until melted and very hot, roughly 30 to 45 seconds depending on power level.
3.  With a blender or immersion blender running, very slowly pour in hot butter.


## Notes

* Use as small of a blender as you can, and as fresh of eggs and high quality butter as you can.
* Pour the butter in very, very slowly or you will risk creating blended scrambled eggs.
* Most standard grocery store eggs have a rather pale yolk and will yield a pale, pastel color sauce. If you want a yellower sauce add a pinch of turmeric.
