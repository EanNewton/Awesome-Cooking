---

## Ingredients

* 2 egg yolks
* 1 teaspoon (5 g) Dijon mustard
* 3 tablespoons (45 ml) white vinegar
* 1⁄2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) Worcestershire sauce
* 3 cups (700 ml) canola or vegetable oil

## Steps

1.  In the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, mix the egg yolks, mustard, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce on medium-high speed for 2 minutes until light and fully incorporated.
3. Very slowly stream in the oil to make the emulsion. You will see the mixture will start to thicken and become increasingly pale. Continue pouring the oil in slowly until it is thick like mayonnaise in a jar, about 4 minutes. Turn the mixer off and add the two salts and garlic powder. Mix on medium high for 1 minute more.
6. Remove from the bowl and refrigerate until needed, up to 1 week
