## Steps

1.  Drop the egg yolks, salt, and lemon juice into a food processor and pulse it to combine. (Now, how much juice comes out of a lemon can obviously vary, but you can tell if you're in the right ballpark based on the consistency of the result. So feel free to be conservative at first, and if it is too thick you can add more lemon juice at the end.) Add the garlic and mustard and pulse to combine thoroughly; I've noticed that if the mustard isn't well incorporated, the oil will never fully emulsify. With the processor running, pour in the grapeseed oil in a thin stream. You are looking for a consistency that will hold its shape when spooned onto something. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days.
