## Steps

1.  Place a griddle or cast iron skillet on medium high heat. When hot, add the chiles and toast, turning frequently until they start to darken, but not blacken. Avoid blackening if possible as this will add a bitterness to your salsa. As the peppers start to change color, remove them to a small saucepan. Fill the saucepan with water to cover; bring to a boil, cover and turn off heat. Allow to steep for 25 minutes.
2.  In the meantime, add the tomatillos, tomatoes, onion and garlic to the hot griddle. Turn vegetables occasionally, charring the tomatillos and tomatoes as much as you can. Remove garlic as soon as it's softened and remove onion when nicely browned. Place tomatoes in a blender first and blend on high to liquify. Next squeeze the garlic out of it's skin and add to the blender along with the tomatillos and onion; pulse to chop. Set aside.
3.  Reserving the cooking liquid, remove the chile peppers from the saucepan to a plate until cool enough to handle. Wearing food handler gloves if you have them, remove stems and seeds from the guajillos; tear the guajillos into chunks and add to blender, discard stems and seeds. Remove and discard the stems from the chiles de arbol. Remove the seeds, reserving a teaspoon of seeds for later (more if you want your salsa especially spicy). Tear the chiles into chunks and add to the blender. Heat the griddle or skillet to medium hot again and quickly dry toast the reserved arbol seeds until fragrant. Add the seeds to the blender along with the lime, salt, cumin and cinnamon. Pulse on high, adding reserved cooking liquid as needed to get a smooth thick consistency.
4.  Taste and add more salt if desired. Store in an airtight container (glass jar, preferable) for up to a week in the refrigerator.
