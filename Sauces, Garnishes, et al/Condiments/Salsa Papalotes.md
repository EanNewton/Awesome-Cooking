# Salsa Papalotes

## San Franciscan, mild hot smokey salsa

---

## Ingredients

* 5 roma tomatoes, cut in half
* 10 dried chiles de arbol, seeded
* 2 teaspoon ground pasilla powder
* Superhot Chiles, to taste
* 1 tablespoon salt, or to taste
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* ¾ cup water
* 2 cloves garlic
* 3 tablespoon white vinegar
* 3 tablespoon vegetable oil
* ¼ cup cilantro
* ¼ cup pepitas, dry roasted


---

## Steps

1.  Preheat broiler. Place the tomatoes, cut side down, on a foil-lined pan and place directly under broiler until the skins are blackened and the tomatoes are soft.
2.  Combine tomatoes, chiles, salt, sugar, garlic, and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat uncovered for 15 min, stirring occasionally. Add vinegar and oil cook for an additional minute. Let cool.
3.  In a food processor, blend tomato mixture with cilantro and pepitas until smooth. Chill completely before serving. Makes about 3 cups total; it should keep refrigerated for a week.

## Notes

* The original Papalotes recipe doesn't contain pepitas, so omit them if desired. Adapted mostly from this article, but I added oil (which adds a creaminess), added garlic, and omitted scallions (add ¼ c. if you so desire).
* The original secret recipe most likely contains papalo instead of cilantro.
