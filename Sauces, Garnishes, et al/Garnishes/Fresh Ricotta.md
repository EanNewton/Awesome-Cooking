# Fresh Ricotta

---

## Ingredients

* 2 cups whole milk
* ¼ tsp table salt
* 2 tbsp distilled white vinegar, or lemon juice


---

## Steps

1.  Line a colander with four layers of cheesecloth or 2 layers of food-safe paper towels and set over a large bowl.
2.  Combine milk, salt, and vinegar or lemon juice in microwave-safe glass 1-quart liquid measure. Microwave on high heat until lightly bubbling around edges, 2 to 4 minutes (milk should register about 165°F on an instant-read thermometer). Remove from the microwave, and stir gently for 5 seconds. Milk should separate into solid white curds and translucent liquid whey. If not, microwave for 30 seconds longer. Repeat until fully separated.
3.  Using a slotted spoon or wire skimmer, transfer curds to the prepared colander, cover the exposed top with plastic wrap, and allow to drain until desired texture is reached. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
