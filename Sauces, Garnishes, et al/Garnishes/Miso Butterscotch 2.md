# Miso Butterscotch #2

## From Mark Bittman

## Makes 2 cups

---

## Ingredients

* ¾ cup cream
* 6 tablespoons (¾ stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces
* ¼ cup miso (red miso is a bit salty for truly sweet applications)
* ¾ cup brown sugar


---

## Steps

1. Combine the cream and butter in a small saucepan, and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter melts.
2. Stir in the miso and sugar and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture is slightly thickened and shiny, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and add a little more sugar if you think it's too salty (remember, you'll be using it in savory dishes).
3. Use right away or refrigerate, well covered, for up to 1 week and rewarm before using to loosen it up.

## Variations

* Possible additions: Chopped nuts; some sesame oil instead of butter; some honey instead of brown sugar.

* On poached pears or apples; marinade for meat; braising base for sturdy vegetables like cabbage, eggplant, turnips or new potatoes; sundae sauce — especially over fruit ice creams or sorbets.

## Notes
Miso butterscotch sounds like dessert — and indeed can be — but it is better imagined as a step beyond the caramel sauce you may know from Vietnamese cooking. Use it on poached pears or apples; as a marinade for meat; as a braising base for sturdy vegetables like cabbage, eggplant, turnips or new potatoes; or as a sundae sauce, especially over fruit ice creams or sorbets.
