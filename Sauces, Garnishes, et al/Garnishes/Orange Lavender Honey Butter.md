# Orange Lavender Honey Butter

---

## Ingredients

* 1 stick of butter, softened
* 1 tablespoon of lavender, pulsed four or five times in a spice grinder
* Zest of one medium orange
* 2 to 3 tablespoons of light honey
* Pinch or two of salt


---

## Steps

1.   Stir all ingredients together in a bowl. Taste and adjust flavors as needed.
2. Transfer your butter to a 12-ounce jar and store in the refrigerator. Or lay the butter out on a 2-foot length of parchment paper and form into a rough log. Fold the paper over the butter. With the back of a cookie sheet or cutting board, push the log forward while pulling on the top sheet of parchment, which will press the butter into a log. Roll the log up and twist the ends.
3. Let your butter sit in the refrigerator overnight so the flavors can meld. It'll keep for weeks, if not longer.

### Notes

* This is a pretty straightforward use for lavender, but it's such an assertive herb that simple, unfussy recipes seem to do it the most justice. It's also a great way to preserve fresh lavender if you can get it. If you have a choice of honey, I'd recommend one that's lighter in color and preferably derived from one type of flower. I used alfalfa, which has a clean flavor that allows the orange and lavender to shine. Lighter honeys taste more flowery, which adds a nice touch as wellâ€”enough to make me want to keep it around for all my lavender-based efforts.
* Use this butter on scones, muffins, biscuits, or cornbread. Or stir it into some French-style beans or lentils. Or eat it out of the fridge feeling far less guilt than you should.
