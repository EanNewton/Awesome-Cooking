## Steps

1.  Heat the oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. Spread the miso out in an even layer, about 1/4 inch thick, on the lined baking sheet. Bake it until the miso is well browned and quite a bit burnt around the edges, about 30 minutes. Remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
2.  Scrape the miso into a blender. Add the mirin, brown sugar, butter, and water to the miso and blend until smooth. You can add a splash more water if the mixture is too tight. Store in the fridge, and nuke or warm on the stove (if you have the patience) before serving.
