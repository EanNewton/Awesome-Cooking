## Steps

1.  Bring all ingredients to a boil in a 4-qt. saucepan over medium-high heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until apricots and cherries are plump, apples are tender, and liquid is reduced, about 40 minutes. Let cool.

## Notes

Traditionally local, seasonal fruits and vegetables are used to make the preserves, including pumpkin, white watermelon, figs, apples, pears, cherries and orange rind.  In addition to the traditional fruits, you can now find mostarda made from apricots, peaches, mandarins, citron, pineapples and prunes.
