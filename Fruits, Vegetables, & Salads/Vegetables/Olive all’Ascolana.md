## Steps

### Prepare the Olives
1. With a small paring knife, moving in a spiral motion around each olive, cut down through to the pit. With the knife inserted in the olive, turn it around and slice it in one spiral continual slice (similar to peeling an apple in with one continual peel).
2. Discard the pit and place olive in bowl of salted water. Repeat with all olives.


### For the Filling
1. In a mini food processor, place the chopped onions, carrot, and celery to finely mince (this is the 'soffrito').
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter with the olive oil.
3. Saute the 'soffrito' of onions, carrot and celery for 5 minutes.
4. Add the minced garlic and saute' for another minute (my addition to this recipe).
5. Add the sausage, ground beef and ground chicken; with the end of a large cooking spatula, chop up the meats as they cook for 5 - 10 minutes until completely cooked.
6. Add wine, nutmeg, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper (to taste) and cook for 10 minutes or until the liquid is slightly reduced.
7. Transfer the entire mixture to a food processor and blend until a smooth paste develops.
8. Add the egg yolk and Parmesan cheese and blend again.
9. Remove the mixture and shape into into a ball; if it is too soft or sticky, place it in the refrigerator to chill. ** This filling can be made up to two days ahead and kept in the refrigerator in an airtight container until ready to stuff the olives.


### To Stuff the Olives
1. Take a ½ teaspoon of the filling; roll it into an oval shape and wrap a pitted olive around it.
2. Press gently to close the olive completely over the filling; repeat with all of the olives. Refrigerate the stuffed olives until ready to fry.


### To Bread and Fry the Olives
1. Have 3 bowls ready. One for flour, one for the eggs, and one for the Italian breadcrumbs.
2. Dip the stuffed olives in the flour, then into the eggs and then into the breadcrumbs. Dip the breaded olives back into the eggs and breadcrumbs for a second coat.
3. With your hands, gently press all of the breading into a nice shape around each olive.
4. Fill a heavy deep frying pan with oil, and heat up the oil. Carefully drop each olive into the oil and fry for 1 minute until gently golden brown, turning them to brown evenly on all sides. Fry in small batches so they don't touch while frying. (If the olives brown sooner than 1 minute, the oil is too hot and the stuffing is not cooking completely, so turn the oil down if this is taking place).
5. Place on a platter with a paper towel.
6. Serve immediately.
