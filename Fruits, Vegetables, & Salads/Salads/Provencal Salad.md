## Steps

### To make the dressing: 

1. In a bowl, whisk together the vinegar, lemon juice, honey, Dijon mustard, shallot, garlic, Old Bay seasoning, salt, pepper, and mustard powder. Slowly stream in the oil, whisking constantly. If the consistency is too thick, whisk in 1 tablespoon water.

### To make the salad: 

1. Place the eggs in a large pot with a tightly fitting lid and fill the pot with cold water, covering the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. As soon as the water reaches a rolling boil, remove the pot from the heat and let the eggs stand, covered, for 7 minutes. Drain the eggs. When cool enough to handle, shell the eggs under tepid running water and pat dry. Set aside.
2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the beans and cook for 30 seconds. With a slotted spoon, transfer the beans to a colander and run them under cold water for 1 minute to stop the cooking and retain their bright green color. Transfer the beans to a large bowl. Keep the cooking water at a simmer.
3. Add the sweet potatoes to the simmering water and cook until they are fork-tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. Drain the potatoes and add to the bowl with the beans.
4. Add the tomatoes, olives, capers, basil, parsley, radicchio, and arugula and toss to combine well.
5. Divide the salad among the 4 plates and lightly dress with the vinaigrette. Top each serving with 1 egg cut in half to that the yolk runs down the salad.
