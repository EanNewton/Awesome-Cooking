# Fraises au Jus Glac√©

## French, strawberries in their juice

---

## Ingredients

* 1 quart fresh strawberries
* 2 to 3 teaspoons fine sugar
* A few drops of lemon juice
* 1 to 2 teaspoons Grand Marnier (optional)
* Torn mint leaves, for garnish (optional)

---

## Steps

1.  Rinse the strawberries under cold running water. Trim and drain the berries, then set aside about one quarter of them, choosing the least attractive ones. Leave the remaining berries whole if they are small. If large, cut them lengthwise into halves or quarters. Refrigerate the berries until serving.
2. Using a blender or food processor, puree the reserved one quarter of the berries with 2 teaspoons of sugar, the lemon juice, and the Grand Marnier, if using. Taste for sweetness, adding more sugar as necessary. Place the strawberry puree in the freezer for 1 hour before serving.
3. Just before serving, divide the whole or cut berries among 4 individual serving bowls, preferably glass, and spoon some of the semi-frozen puree on each portion, stirring gently to mix. Garnish each serving with a mint leaf or two if desired. Serve at once.
