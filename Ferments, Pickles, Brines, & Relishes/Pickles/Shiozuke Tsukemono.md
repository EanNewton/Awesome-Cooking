## Steps

1.  For a full brine: use between 50 and 100 grams salt, pickle for 6 to 12 hours and enjoy within 3 to 4 days.
2.  For a quick pickle (asazuke): use between 20 and 50 grams salt, pickle for 2 to 3 hours and enjoy within 1 to 2 days.
3.  Weigh and make note of the total combined weight of the vegetables and additional flavors to be pickled.
4.  Dissolve the salt completely in the water over medium heat. Allow to completely cool before using.
5.  Place the vegetables in a jar or deep baking dish, cover with brine, place a plate or dish on top of the vegetables and weigh down with 1.5 to 2 times the previously noted weight. 
6.  Brine in the fridge, denser vegetables need longer. When done, discard the brine and store pickles in a clean container.
