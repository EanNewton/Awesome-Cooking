---

## Ingredients

* 8 medium limes with soft skins
* 2 tbsp rock salt, finely crushed (or cooking salt)
* 10 green chillies
* 2 whole dried red chillies
* 1 tbsp fenugreek seeds
* 1 tbsp cumin seeds
* 1.5cm (½ inch) piece of turmeric root, or ¼ tsp ground turmeric
* 100ml (7 tbsp) lime juice (about 3-4 limes)

## Steps

1.  Cut the limes into quarters without slicing all the way down to the bottom so the lime quarters stay connected together. Lightly cover the inside edges with the salt and put them in a non-metal container or a large glass bottle with a non-corrosive lid.
2.  Make a small slit lengthwise down each green chili, leaving the seeds and stems intact, and add them to the salted lime. Mix well and put the lid on. Leave to marinate for 3 days.
3.  After 3 days marinating, take the limes out of the container and lay them out in a large shallow dish to dry. Put them uncovered in the sun until they are very dry. This may take 2 or 3 days in the sunshine.
4.  When the limes are ready, gently dry-roast the dried chillies, fenugreek, and cumin seeds, and the turmeric if using the root in a dry frying pan or skillet until they begin to color. Take them off the heat and leave to cool. Put them in a spice grinder and grind to a fine powder. If using ground turmeric, add it now and stir to combine.
5.  Mix the lime juice with this prepared spice powder and pour it all over the limes. Mix well and store the lime pickle in a sterilized airtight jar.
