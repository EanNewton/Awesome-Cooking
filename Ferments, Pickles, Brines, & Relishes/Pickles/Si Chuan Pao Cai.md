## Steps

1.  Bring the water to a boil with the salt, stirring to dissolve the salt. When it has completely dissolved, set aside and leave to cool.
2.  Place the cooled water in a very clean pickle jar. Add all the other brine ingredients and give them a good stir.
3.  Clean the vegetables thoroughly, removing stalks and any whiskery bits from the radishes. Allow them to dry completely. Cut the vegetables into small chunks and put them into the pickle jar. Wedge a small glass or ceramic dish or lid on top of them to make sure that the vegetables are completely immersed in the brine. Seal the lid and leave in a cool, dark place for at least 24 hours. The flavors will improve the longer you leave them, they are very good after about a week. You will notice a slight fizzing when you unseal the jar -- this is part of the fermentation process.
4.  To serve the pickles, scoop out enough to fill a small dipping dish, drizzle with a little chili oil, and sprinkle with a few pinches of sugar if you wish.
5.  As you eat the pickles, you can replenish the jar, adding more salt, sugar, and wine as you do so, to keep the brine good and salty.
