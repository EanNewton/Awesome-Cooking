## Steps

1.  Heat the oil in a medium, lidded frying pan or skillet over medium heat and saute the onions until soft and golden brown. If the oil is quickly absorbed by the onions, add a few more tablespoons of oil. Take the pan off the heat and remove the onions using a slotted spoon, gently squeezing any excess oil back into the pan.
2.  Put the pan back on low heat and allow the oil to heat up again. Add a little extra oil to the pan if it is looking dry. Add the garlic, curry leaves, chili flakes, cardamom, cinnamon, rampe, cloves, and lemongrass and saute for about 5 minutes or until thoroughly aromatic.
3.  Add the sauteed onions back into the pan and mix well. Add the tamarind water and coconut milk, and give it a good stir. Half-cover the pan with the lid and simmer on a low heat for 5-6 minutes until the liquid has reduced by half.
4.  Then, add the sugar and lime juice. Mix well and simmer until it begins to dry out, about 2 minutes. Keep on eye on it to make sure that the onions do not burn on the bottom.
