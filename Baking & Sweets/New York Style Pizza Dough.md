## Steps

1.  Measure dry (no yeast). Measure wet (+ yeast). Mix to dissolve yeast. Dry into wet. Stir with a metal spoon until it's too stiff to stir, then knead, by hand or by machine, until the dough is just about smooth (3-6 minutes). Ball and place in lightly oiled, large round disposable covered containers. Refrigerate 2 days. Remove from fridge 3 hours before baking.
2. Preheat stone for 60-80 minutes at the highest setting your oven goes to (using convection, if your oven has it). Stone should be positioned on an oven shelf that's about 6-7" from the broiler.


    * Dust wooden peel with flour
    * Stretch skin to 16" and place on peel
    * Quickly dress the pizza, shaking between each topping to make sure the skin doesn't stick
    * Launch
    * Turn pizza every couple minutes with metal peel
    * Bake until pizza top and bottom are well colored
    * Use broiler if top needs more browning
    * Retrieve, using metal peel, onto cooling rack

3. Allow to cool 7 minutes

## Notes
* This is easy but not fast.
* You will need a pizza stone to successfully bake this pizza in a home oven. If you don't have one, order one online.
