* 8 oz light brown sugar
* 7 1/4 oz white sugar

## Steps

1.  Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350 F.
2.  Set a handful of chocolate aside. Place remainder in a medium bowl, sift flour on top, and toss to combine.
3.  Combine butter, brown sugar, white sugar, salt, baking soda, baking powder, vanilla, and nutmeg in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With the mixer running, crack in the egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour / chocolate, and mix to form a stiff dough.
4.  Divide into 32 1 1/2 oz portions (2 tbsp) or 64 3/4 oz (1 tbsp) portions. Arrange on parchment lined aluminum baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between them. Sprinkle with reserved chocolate and a pinch each of kosher salt. Bake until the cookies are puffed and pale gold around the edges but steamy in the middle, about 15 minutes for large, 12 for small. Or, for crunchy cookies, continue baking until golden, 3 to 5 minutes more.
5.  Cool on the baking sheets until set, about 5 minutes. Enjoy warm, or store in an airtight container for up to 2 days at room temperature.

## Make Ahead

* Divide the portioned dough among several heavy duty zip-top bags and refrigerate for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 6 months. Let stand at room temperature until quite soft (about 70 F), and bake as directed.


## Variations

### Brown Butter

* Up the butter to 10 oz and use 2 eggs. In a 2-quart stainless steel saucier, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Increase to medium and simmer, stirring with a heat-resistant spatula, while the butter hisses and pops. Continue cooking and stirring, scraping up any brown bits that form on the bottom of the pan, until butter is golden yellow and perfectly silent. Pour into the bowl of a stand mixer, making sure to scrape up all the toasty brown bits, and cool until semi-solid and opaque. Proceed with the recipe as directed, incorporating the second egg after the first.

### Double Chocolate

* For soft cookies with a brownie-like intensity, reduce flour to 6 oz and sift with 6 oz Dutch-process cocoa powder. Prepare the dough as directed, but flatten each portion into a 3/4 inch disc. Bake 8 minutes for small cookies, 10 minutes for large.


### Homemade Famous Amos

* Hypercrisp and crunchy, these bit-sized cookies get an extra layer of flavor and crunch from 4 oz toasted pecans. Chop along with the chocolate, and proceed with the recipe as directed. Divide into 1 tbsp (3/4 oz) portions and bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Makes 64 cookies.

### Malted Milk Chocolate

* This variation is best with milk chocolate, one fairly intense and the other a touch milky. Increase white sugar to 14 oz and omit brown sugar. Along with butter, add 1 oz barley malt syrup and 2 1/4 oz malted milk powder.

### Maple Walnut

* Toss 6 oz toasted walnut pieces with the flour and chocolate. Increase white sugar to 10 1/2 oz and omit brown sugar. Along with the butter, add 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon and 3 oz grade B maple syrup. For either size cookie, bake about 2 minutes longer than directed.

### White Chocolate Macadamia Nut

* Reduce chocolate to 9 oz of your favorite white chocolate, mixed with 7 oz lightly toasted macadamia nuts.

### Gluten-Free

* Replace the all-purpose flour with 4 oz white rice flour, 4 oz oat flour, and 4 oz teff flour.
