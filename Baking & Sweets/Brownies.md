## From King Arthur FLour

## Ingredients

* 6 ounces unsweetened baking chocolate
* 12 tablespoons (1 ½ sticks, 6 ounces) unsalted butter
* 5 large eggs
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 2 ½ cups (17 ½ ounces) sugar
* ⅓ cup (3 ⅝ ounces) light corn syrup (optional, corn syrup will keep the brownies fresh longer and will make them denser--almost-but-not-quite-gooey)
* 1 ⅓ cups (5 ¾ ounces) unbleached all purpose flour
* Optional add-ins: 1 ½ cups chopped walnuts or pecans, 1 ½ cups mini marshmallows, 1 cup melted caramel, 1 cup chocolate chips

## Steps

1.  In a medium sized saucepan, melt the chocolate and butter together over low heat. Set aside to cool slightly.
2. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, vanilla, salt, sugar, and corn syrup together until light and fluffy, which takes a few minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 375. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch pan.
4. Stir the flour into the chocolate and butter mixture. Fold the chocolate batter into the egg mixture, stirring to combine. Stir in optional ingredients if using.
5. Spread the batter in the pan. For an extra glossy top, brush with 1 tablespoon milk. Bake the brownies for 35 minutes; the top should be crisp, but a toothpick inserted in the center will come out coated with chocolate. Remove the brownies from the oven, and let them cool for several hours before cutting into squares.


## Variations
* Add a small amount of coffee or espresso to bring out chocolate flavors
* Top with coarse salt
* Add crushed bits of toffee to dough
* Use browned butter
