## From King Arthur Flour

---

## Ingredients

* 12 tablespoons (1 ½ sticks, 6 ounces) butter
* 1 ¼ cups (10 ounces) light brown sugar, firmly packed
* ¼ cup (2 ½ ounces) light corn syrup
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* ¾ teaspoon baking powder
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon baking soda
* 1 large egg
* 2 ¼ cups (9 ½ ounces) unbleached all purpose flour
* 1 cup (4 ounces) chopped nuts
* 2 cups (12 ounces) semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips, or to taste

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 375F.
2. Beat the butter, light brown sugar, and corn syrup together until fluffy. Beat in the vanilla, baking powder, salt, and baking soda, and then mix in the egg. Beat well. Beat in the flour, then stir in the nuts and chocolate chip. Drop the cookie dough by the rounded tablespoon onto lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pans.
3. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, just until lightly browned at the edges. For the chewiest cookies, do not overbake. The cookies will look slightly underdone in the middle, but will set up as they cool.
4. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, and then remove to a wire rack to cool completely. To maintain the chewiest texture, store in an airtight container with a slice of apple or sugar softener.


## Variations
* Add a small amount of coffee or espresso to bring out the chocolate flavors.
* Top with coarse salt
* Add crushed bits of toffee to dough
* Use browned butter for a more toasted/nutty flavor.
* If cookies spread too much, refrigerate the dough for several hours to overnight.
* An ice cream scoop will pull the perfect portion for a cookie in a nice consistent shape.
