# No-Bake Chocolate-Pretzel-Peanut Butter Squares

---

## Ingredients

* 12 tbsp butter, melted
* 2 cup pretzels, crushed 
* 1 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar
* 1 cup + 1/4 cup peanut butter
* 1 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips

---

## Steps

1.  In a medium bowl, add the melted butter, pretzel crumbs, confectioner's sugar and 1 cup of the peanut butter and stir together until well combined. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of an ungreased baking dish. 
2.  Combine the chocolate chips and the remaining 1/4 cup peanut butter in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate and peanut butter are melted and smooth; two intervals should be enough. Mix to blend, then spread over the peanut butter-pretzel layer. 
3.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before cutting into squares.
