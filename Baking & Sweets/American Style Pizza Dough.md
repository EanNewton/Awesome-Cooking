## Steps

### Poolish
1. Combine 25% of the flour with an equal amount of water -- subtract this amount from the total recipe. Add 0.3% of the total yeast.
2. Leave on the counter for 12 - 14 hours.


### Dough
1. In a large bowl: combine poolish, remaining flour and water. Mix by hand for 30 seconds or so until everything is roughly incorporated. Let this rest for 25 minutes (this is called 'autolyse')
2. Add remaining yeast, salt, and olive oil to the bowl. Mix on low for 2 minutes then medium for 6 minutes. If you're mixing by hand, go slow and then work faster. The dough should be incorporated, but not smooth.
3. Transfer dough to a large, clean bowl or tub and allow it to rise for 3.5 - 4 hours. It should double in size. This is called 'bulk fermentation.'
4. Stretch and fold dough every 45 minutes during the bulk fermentation.
5. To do a stretch and fold, with clean, lightly moistened hands, reach into the bowl, grab the dough from the bottom, and stretch it straight up, then over and back down into the bowl. Repeat this process once or twice more, and that's it.


### Shaping
1. Transfer to a cutting board or a clean countertop. Divide, measure the balls so they're 260g each. Shape the balls, then allow these to rise on the counter for 2.5 hours.
2. Hand stretch the dough balls and form your pizzas.


### The Bake
1. Preheat your oven to it's highest setting and preheat your stone or steel for 30 minutes, then broil for 30 minutes. I like to have the rack in the middle or one step up from the middle for a 3.5 minute - 6 minute bake using the broiler.


## Notes
* This is neither fast nor easy but the extra work really pays off.
* If you're comfortable making dough and have a good bake technique down, this will work nicely.
