## Steps

1.  Make the biga by stirring together the yeast, flour, and water. The dough will be quite stiff. Place it in a lightly greased bowl, cover it, and let it rest at room temperature overnight.
2.  Next day, combine the biga with the remaining ingredients (except the pecans and fruit) in a large bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, mixing to form a shaggy dough. Knead the dough until smooth, then place it in a lightly greased bowl and let it rest for 1 hour; it will become quite puffy, though it may not double in bulk.
3.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, gently deflate it, and knead in the nuts and fruit. Shape the dough into a slightly flattened ball and place it on a lightly greased sheet pan. Cover the pan with a proof cover or some lightly greased plastic wrap. Let the loaf rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until it's puffy.
4.  Preheat the oven to 350 F. Bake the bread for about 40 minutes (tenting it lightly with aluminum foil for the final 15 minutes) until its interior registers 190 F on an instant read thermometer. Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack.
