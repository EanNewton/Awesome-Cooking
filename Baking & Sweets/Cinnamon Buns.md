## Steps

### For the dough: 
1. Mix and knead together all the dough ingredients, by hand or mixer, to form a soft, smooth dough. Place it in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 ½ hours; it should almost double in size.

### To assemble: '
1. Turn out the dough onto a lightly greased work surface and roll it into a rectangle measuring about 11x20 inches. Spread a thin layer of soft butter over the dough, leaving about 1 inch uncovered on the short side nearest you. Sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar and nuts, raisins, or chips of your choice. Starting with the short edge covered with filling, roll the dough into a log. Use a serrated knife to gently saw the log in half, then cut each side of the log into six equal pieces. Place the buns in a lightly greased 9x13 inch pan, pressing down slightly. Cover the buns and let them rise in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1 ¼ hours, until they’re quite puffy.
2. Preheat the oven to 350.
3. Bake the buns for 20 to 25 minutes, until they’re golden brown. Remove from the oven and let them cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn them out of the pan and them cool to just slightly warm before frosting.
4. To make the icing: Mix the heavy cream and confectioner’s sugar to make a creamy glaze; use water for a thinner glaze. Spread the icing on the buns.

## Notes
Try other fillings such as pizza rolls, cured ham and mozzarella, or fruit
