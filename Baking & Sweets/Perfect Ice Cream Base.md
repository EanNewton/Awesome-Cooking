## Steps

1.  In a pot combine all the ingredients over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until it reaches 160 degrees. Pull pot halfway off heat and lower heat.
2. Hold mixture at 162 degrees for 25 minutes, stirring constantly. Add-ins such as vanilla, mint, spices, herbs, etc should be added during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Mixture should reduce 13 percent by weight.
3. Fill a large bowl with ice water, place a slightly smaller bowl inside. Pour the cream mixture through a fine mesh strainer into the smaller bowl, stir occasionally until chilled, transfer to the refrigerator.
4. Follow your ice cream manufacturerâ€™s instructions.


## Notes
* This is my go to ice cream base. You can add any fold-in that you want, remember that fruit gets icy, this can be slightly lessened with addition of fruit-syrups, macerated fruits, or alcohol, all of which will lower the freezing point resulting in a softer ice cream though.
* Be extremely careful while cooking the custard, too much heat will result in scrambled eggs (visible when run through a fine mesh strainer) and too little heat will result in the custard not setting properly.
* While many brands and shops glorify their high butterfat recipes, this is almost entirely a marketing ploy. Around 14% or higher (depending on personal taste) it begins to feel like biting into a stick of butter.
* Likewise, under 10% or so and the ice cream will have an odd off taste, feeling watery instead of creamy on the tongue.
* While a change of 1 to 2% in butterfat may not sound like a lot, think of the difference in taste between non-fat, 2%, and whole milk. A small change makes a big difference. I find 11 to 12% to be the sweet spot for my tastes.
