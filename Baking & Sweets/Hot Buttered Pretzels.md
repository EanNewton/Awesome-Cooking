# Hot Buttered Pretzels

## From King Arthur Flour

---

## Ingredients

### Dough
* 2 ½ cups (10 ½ ounces) unbleached all purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 ¼ teaspoons instant yeast
* ⅞ to 1 cup (7 to 8 ounces) warm water (Use the greater amount in the winter, the lesser amount in the summer, and somewhere in between in the spring and fall. Your goal is a soft dough.)

### Topping
* ½ cup (4 ounces) warm water
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* Coarse, kosher, or pretzel salt
* 3 tablespoons (1 ½ ounces) salted butter, melted

## Steps

1.  Place all the dough ingredients in a bowl and beat until well combined. Knead the dough, by hand or mixer, for about 5 minutes, until it’s soft, smooth, and quite slack. Dust the dough with flour (to keep it from sticking) and place it in a plastic bag; close the bag, leaving room for the dough to expand, and let it rest for 30 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 500.
3. Prepare two baking sheets by spraying them with vegetable oil spray or lining them with parchment paper.
4. Transfer the dough to lightly greased work surface and divide it into eight equal pieces (about 2 ¼ ounces each). Let the pieces rest, uncovered, for 5 minutes.
5. Roll each piece of dough into a long thin rope and twist each rope into a pretzel. Dip the pretzels in the warm water mixed with 1 teaspoon sugar, and place them on the baking sheets. Sprinkle them heavily with the salt. Let them rest, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
6. Bake the pretzels for 8 to 9 minutes, until they’re golden brown, reversing the baking sheets halfway through.
7. Remove the pretzels from the oven and brush them thoroughly with the melted butter. Keep brushing the butter on until you’ve used it all; it may seem like a lot, but that’s what gives these pretzels their ethereal taste, trust me, the more butter and salt the better they taste. Eat the pretzels warm, or reheat them in an oven or microwave.


## Notes
* This recipe doesn’t make much dough, and these pretzels will be eaten quickly. Try doubling the batch size.
* For a double batch increase yeast to 5 teaspoons instead of 4 ½. I prefer Red Star brand yeast.
* You can sub up to 20% whole wheat flour (1 cup whole wheat to 4 cups AP for a double batch) to improve the color and flavor, though the dough may be harder to worker with.
* The pretzels will go from uncooked to golden to burnt in the blink of an eye so keep a close watch on them during the last few minutes of baking.
