## Steps
1.  In a medium sized mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, buttermilk, melted butter, and vanilla. In another bowl whisk together the dry ingredients; combine the wet and dry ingredients just until smooth.
2. Spray the waffle iron with a nonstick cooking spray before preheating it. For an 8-inch round waffle iron, use about ⅓ cup batter. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the iron stops steaming.
