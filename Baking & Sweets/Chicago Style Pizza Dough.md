## Steps

1. Mix this around to incorporate, let it rest while you get plenty of flour down on your work surface, I go through about another 5-8 Tbs or more of flour here - keep adding flour, don't be scared. Pull out the dough and knead the dough out by rolling and folding in alternate directions making sure to stay right at the edge of sticky. Knead this with vigor for 5 minutes. Let rise...
2. 2 hours, then punch it down in the center...
3. 1 hour, then pull it out onto a floured surface and divide, I save half for later or make two. The dough can be refrigerated for up to three days and increases in flavor, and you can freeze it for up to a month.
4. Let the portions you plan to use proof for another 30 minutes.


### Method
1. 1/3 lb of whole milk mozzarella from the deli counter, sliced. (If you don't use whole milk the crust will come out plasticky and far too chewy.)
2. Pizza sauce
3. Topping: focus on low moisture veggies like frozen chopped spinach, squeezed dry. You can also put raw Italian sausage on in chunks, it will cook at these temps.
4. 12 inch cast iron pan, with a light coat of olive oil on the bottom surface. (Unfortunately cast-iron is all that will work here. The thickness of the metal and the cook time will allow the cheese to carbonize, while not burning the bottom of the pizza and allowing a good cook time.)
5. Break mozzarella slices in half and line the outer wall of the pan with cheese. The cheese wall should be very thin.
6. Drop dough in and spread evenly to the edges.
7. Line the surface evenly with cheese slices one layer deep plus overlap.
8. A heavy load of pizza sauce spread out, 3-4 heaping spoonfuls. (And yes you read that right, cheese first!)
9. Load on your toppings, and another lighter layer of cheese. (Couple slices broken up)


### Bake
1. 30 minutes at 450° for a chewy crust and 460° for a crispy crust. (Center rack)
