## Steps

1.  Cut the pork belly lengthwise into strips about 2 inches wide. Place them in a shallow container that will fit into your refrigerator. Splash the strips with about 1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine, and then rub them evenly with the salt and saltpeter. Place in the refrigerator for 3 days, turning the strips over after a day or two.
2. When 3 days have passed, remove the belly strips, pierce them with the meat hooks, and hang them in a cool and well-ventilated place overnight or for a few hours to air-dry.
3. When the meat is dry, combine the seasonings in a small bowl and rub them all over the strips. Return the strips to the refrigerator for another 2 days. Then take them out and hang them up again to air-dry.
4. To eat the meat, wash off all the paste under warm water and then steam it until it is cooked through. Allow the meat to cool thoroughly and cut into fairly thin slices to serve.
5. Serve as an appetizer with a pile of Sichuanese chili powder, or any chili sauce you prefer.
