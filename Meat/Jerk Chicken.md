---

## Ingredients
* 3 lbs drumsticks (10–12 pieces)
* 8 garlic cloves
* 2 Scotch bonnet peppers, stems removed
* 2 inch piece of ginger, peeled and sliced
* 3/4 cup chopped scallions (about 4)
* 1/4 cup thyme leaves
* 1/3 cup lime juice
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* 2 tbsp honey
* 1 tbsp allspice berries
* 1 tbsp kosher or sea salt

## Steps

1. Arrange the drumsticks on a cutting board and use a small, sharp knife to diagonally score the chicken down to the bone at 1-inch intervals, 3–4 slashes per drumstick. This will help the marinade penetrate the chicken and allow the chicken to cook faster.
2. Combine the garlic, peppers, ginger, scallions, thyme, lime juice, oil, honey, allspice, and salt in a blender and process until smooth.
3. Place the drumsticks in a gallon-sized Ziploc bag and pour the marinade over the chicken. Seal the bag and knead the marinade around, coating the chicken evenly. Marinate the chicken for at least 12 hours and up to 2 days.
4. Heat a grill to medium high or an oven to 500°. Remove the chicken from the marinade and scrape off any excess. Grill, covered, or roast the chicken, turning often, until charred and cooked through, 25–30 minutes.
