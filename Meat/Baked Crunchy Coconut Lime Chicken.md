## Steps

1. Combine marinade ingredients and chicken and allow to soak in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, mixing occasionally.
2. Mix all yogurt dip ingredients and refrigerate until ready to serve. Preferably make this the day before to allow the flavors to marry.
2. Preheat the oven to 450 F
3. Setup three bowls. Mix flour, salt, and pepper in the first; beaten eggs and coconut water or milk in the second; and breadcrumbs with dried coconut in the third. Dip chicken into the egg mix, wipe off the excess, then into the flour mixture. Dip again into egg mixture, then into the coconut and breadcrumbs to coat.
4. Bake until golden brown, about 20-25 minutes, on a greased baking sheet. Remove from the oven and immediately transfer to a wire rack.
