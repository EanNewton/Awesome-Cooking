## Steps

1.  Freeze the chuck until frozen but not stiff, about 1 hour. Remove from the freezer and season with Fifth Dimension Powder or 1⁄2 teaspoon (2.5 g) kosher salt. Grind the chuck according to the technique in chapter 1 (page 15). If you’re using ground chuck, mix in the Fifth Dimension Powder or 1⁄2 teaspoon (2.5 g) kosher salt. refrigerate while you prepare the skillet.
8. Heat the skillet over high heat until very hot. If you have an infrared thermometer, the skillet should register at least 500°F (250°C). or test by brushing on a bit of oil. When the skillet starts to smoke, it is ready.
12. Remove the chuck from the refrigerator. Divide into four 6-ounce (170 g) portions and shape the patties according to technique in chapter 1 (page 16). Season with salt and pepper.
15. Brush the skillet with oil and arrange the patties without overcrowding. Cook for 3 minutes. Turn the patties over and cook for 2 minutes more. If you like your burgers rare (which we recommend), the internal temperature should register 120° to 125°F (49° to 52°C); medium-rare burgers should have an internal temperature of 130° to 135°F (54° to 57°C). We don’t want to know about it if you cook your burgers any more than that. (See sidebar below.)
21. Transfer the burgers to a platter and lay a slice of cheese on top if desired. Tent the platter with foil and allow the burgers to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.
23. Alternatively, you can grill the burgers. Prepare the grill and follow the instructions in the Wood-Fired and Charcoal Grilling section in chapter 1 (pages 18–19).
25. To serve: Place the burgers on the bottom halves of the buns. Spread Best.Mayo.ever. (recipe follows) and/or mustard on the top halves and add your favorite toppings. our preferences are cold, crispy iceberg lettuce, thinly sliced tomatoes (in-season only), Caramelized onions (page 158), Gram’s Bread-and-Butter Pickles (page 31), and any of the Wicked Killer Burger Toppings in this chapter
