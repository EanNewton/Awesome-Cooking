## Steps

### To make the nuoc cham: 
1. In a bowl or jar, stir all the ingredients together until the sugar is dissolved. Refrigerate until ready to use.

### For the Beef:
1. About 30 minutes before serving, place the beef in the freezer; you want it to be partially frozen so that it’s easy to slice thinly.
2. Remove the beef from the freezer and slice the meat against the grain into 12 very thin slices. Use the side of your knife or a meat mallet to flatten any thick or uneven slices.
3. Place the beef on a sheet pan. Squeeze the lemon and half of the lime wedges over the top, and drizzle with 1/4 cup nuoc cham. Sprinkle with salt and cubeb pepper. Let sit for 5–10 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, combine the rau ram, mint, cilantro, Thai basil, red onion, shallot, and chili in a large bowl. Dress with 1 tablespoon nuoc cham, and toss to combine.
5. Add the beef slices one at a time to the bowl, being careful to avoid clumping. Add a little more nuoc cham and toss to coat. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon fried shallots over the top of the salad, and toss again to combine.
6. Pile the salad onto a serving plate. Drizzle with more nuoc cham, sprinkle with salt and cubeb pepper, and top with the remaining fried shallots. Serve with the remaining lime wedges.
