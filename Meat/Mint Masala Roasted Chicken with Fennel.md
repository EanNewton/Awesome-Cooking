## Steps

1.  In a blender or food processor, blend the mint, Serrano chilies, 6 garlic cloves, lime juice, salt, and 1/2 cup water to make a smooth paste. Spoon the paste into a small bowl and whisk in the olive oil.
2. Heat the oven to 425°F.
3. Remove the giblets from the chicken. Rinse the chicken inside and out and pat dry with paper towels. Using half the mint paste and your fingers, season the chicken beneath the skin, inside the cavity, and all over the surface of the skin. Brush the chicken inside and out with the melted butter.
4. Stuff the chicken with the lemon, halved garlic bulb, and thyme. Tie the legs together with butcher’s twine.
5. Scatter the onion, fennel, and potatoes in the bottom of a roasting pan and toss with the remaining mint paste. Place the chicken on top of the potatoes and tuck the wingtips under. Roast the chicken for 1 1/2 hours, or until juices run clear and a thermometer reads 165°F when inserted in the thickest part of the thigh.
6. Remove the chicken and vegetables to a platter, spoon any pan drippings over the potatoes, and tent with foil to retain moisture. Let the chicken rest for 20 minutes to allow the juices to settle. Carve and serve with the roasted potatoes, onion, and fennel. Garnish with fennel if desired.
