# Lemon Curd

## from GrassBlokyMC

---

## Ingredients

* Zest of 1 lemon
* Juice of one lemon (I found this wasn't sour enough, and didn't have anymore, so I added 1/2 cup water mixed with a tablespoon of citric acid.)
* 3/8 cup sugar
* 1 egg plus 1 yolk (honestly, it might be better if it was just 2 yolks, the white can easily solidify because of the lemon juice)
* Around 2 3/4 tablespoons butter

## Steps

1.  First, whisk all of the ingredients together except for the butter. Microwave it in a large bowl, as it can bubble up quite a bit, for 1 minute intervals. 
2.  In-between minutes, whisk it. Repeat whisking and warming up the mixture for 1 min. until the curd is almost set and thick/jiggly like jello. 
3.  Add the butter and pour into a jar. To enhance the flavor, you may want to chill it before eating overnight, as well.
