## Ingredients

* 1 cup+2 tbsp (255g) unsalted butter at room temperature
* 2 cups (250g) all purpose flour
* 1.5 cups toasted chopped pecans, divided
* If you don't have them toasted just put pecans in a toaster oven for 5 minutes.
* 2 tsp (9g) baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup (120 ml) half and half room temperature. If you don't have any, use half a cup of milk and half a cup of heavy cream.
* 1 tbsp (15 ml) vanilla extract
* 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs at room temperature
* 2 cups of maple syrup, cold. I CANNOT STRESS IT ENOUGH DUE TO THE SCIENCE OF THIS IT NEEDS TO BE COLD. DO NOT TAKE IT OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR UNTIL THE CAKE IS OUT OF THE OVEN.

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 350f or 175c. Grease a 2.5x9x13 inch (6x23x33 cm) pan with 2 tablespoons of butter, then sprinkle with 4 tbsp of flour. bang it over the sink to remove excess flour, then set aside. In a medium bowl sift the remaining 1.75 cups (219g) of flour. Place 1/2 cup (55g) of pecans in a food processor and sprinkle with 2 tbsp of sifted flour FROM THE BOWL YOU ALREADY SIFTED FROM. Then process until the mixture is a fine texture. Add the processed pecans to the sifted flour, and mix in the baking powder and salt. Use a fork to fully mix and incorporate the ingredients. In a large measuring cup, measure the half and half and vanilla, then set aside for later.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the remaining butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light in color and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. If you do this by hand it'll take MUCH longer, and it's more of a workout. Add the eggs one at a time, waiting for each egg to be fully incorporated before adding the next.
3. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the half-and-half, making sure to start and finish with the flour mixture. Once you add the last portion of the flour, stop the mixer, add the remaining 1 cup (109g) of pecans and use a rubber spatula to incorporate the pecans and any flour residue. 
4. Spread the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30 to 35 minutes on the middle rack. It's ready when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean and the top is lightly golden. Remove the cake from the oven and immediately pour the cold maple syrup on top (the full 2 cups). Allow the cake to soak up the syrup and cool before topping it with whipped cream. I recommend a sprinkle of chopped pecans on top of the whipped cream.
