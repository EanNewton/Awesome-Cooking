## Ingredients

* 1 nine-inch pie crust (homemade preferred)
* 4 large eggs from Happy Chickens

* 50 grams unsalted butter, melted then cooled briefly
* 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1 -2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 2 teaspoons corn starch
* 3 tablespoons coarse corn meal

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to a fairly low 160C (320F). Prepare a nine-inch pie dish with crust crimping the edges any way you see fit. Return to the fridge to chill as you prepare the filling.
3. Whisk the eggs and sugar in an upright mixer or by hand with a balloon whisk until light in colour, about three minutes. Add the butter, salt, lemon, and cornstarch whisking thirty seconds longer to blend well. Add the cornmeal and stir to combine ensuring there are no lumps remaining.
5. Fill the prepared pie crust and bake for 35-45 minutes until the golden brown top forms and crisps slightly and there is only slight ‘wobble’ to the centre when jiggled. Remove to cool completely before slicing, at least two hours but preferably longer. I said COMPLETELY or you’ll have chess pie soup on your hands. Even the fridge might not be a bad idea after the first hour.
