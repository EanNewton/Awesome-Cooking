# Easy Orange (or other citrus) Marmalade

## from MrSporksHands

## Ingredients

* 500g of fruit will yield about 1 litre of marmalade but use any amount you wish, scrubbed clean

---

## Steps

1.  Slice off any ‘navel’ ends. Weigh fruit then measure an equal weight of sugar. Slice whole fruit with peel thinly, remove any seeds (food processor recommended).
5. Place fruit and any collected juice in a heavy bottom pan with barely enough water to cover !! DO NOT ADD SUGAR YET !! Bring to a boil. Immediately drop heat to low and simmer 40 minutes.
9. (DO NOT RAISE HEAT ABOVE MEDIUM-LOW FOR THE REST OF THE COOK – It must all cook and come to temperature SLOWLY for natural pectin to activate) Stir every 10 minutes, add JUST enough water to prevent scorching each time. Add sugar and a good pinch of salt. Stir every 2 minutes until temperature reads 105 C /220 F, usually about 20 minutes longer.
13. Cool well, move to sterilized glass jars, refrigerate up to several months.
14. Dream of Spain over your morning toast!

## Notes

Little old grannies will faff about with all manner of fiddly prep on the oranges for local bragging rights at marmalade competitions. For my tastes, none of it matters and I just slice up the fruit and chuck it in the pot.
