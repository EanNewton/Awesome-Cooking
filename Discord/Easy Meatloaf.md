## Steps

1.  Mix together well in a bowl with your hands. Use gloves if you are worried about cross contamination. Press into a parchment lined loaf pan, evenly. 
2.  Combine well with spoon. Spread sauce over top of raw meatloaf.
3.  Bake at 350F for 1 hour.
4.  Take out and let sit for 10 minutes. Slice and serve with choice of sides. Salads, steamed greens, and sweet potatoes all pair well.

### Tip
* Slice from the middle. There should be no pink. If pink, put back in oven for another 15 minutes.
* You can substitute the oats for bread crumbs
* If you do not have a loaf pan, you can bake on a lined baking sheet. Just shape the meatloaf by hand.
