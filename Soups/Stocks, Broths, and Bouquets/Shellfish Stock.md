# Shellfish Stock

## From Jennifer McGruthe’s Broth & Stock from the Nourished Kitchen

---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound shellfish shells, such as the shells of shrimp, lobster, and crab
* 1 cup dry white wine
* 2–4 quarts cold water


---

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2.  Arrange the shellfish shells in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast them in the heated oven until they turn crisp and brown at the edges, about 20 minutes.
3.  Remove the baking sheet from the oven and transfer the shells to a heavy stockpot. Stir in the wine. Cover with water by 1 inch (about 2–4 quarts) and then slowly bring the broth to a bare simmer over medium heat. Skim off and discard any foam or scum that rises to the surface of the stock. Simmer the stock for about 45 minutes, or until fragrant but not overpowering.
4.  Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve and use it right away or store it in two 1-quart jars, sealed tightly in the fridge for no more than 5 days. Alternatively, you can freeze the stock for up to 6 months, making sure to allow plenty of head-space if you’re using glass jars.

## Notes

Unlike meat stocks and broths, shellfish shells, which form the base for this stock, are not particularly rich in protein, so they will not yield as firm a gel; rather, these shells are rich in trace minerals, notably selenium, which acts as an antioxidant while also supporting thyroid function. If you have just shelled shrimp or other shellfish, you can make this stock right away. You can also toss shells into a resealable plastic bag, store them in the freezer for up to 6 months, and pull it out when you need to make stock.
