# Long-Simmered Roasted Beef Bone Broth

## From Jennifer McGruthe’s Broth & Stock from the Nourished Kitchen

---

## Ingredients

* 5 pounds beef soup bones, such as neck and marrow bones or knuckles and shins
* 1 cup red wine
* 4–6 quarts cold water


---

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 425°F.
2.  Place the bones in a single layer in a roasting pan and roast in the heated oven for 45 minutes. Transfer the bones to a heavy stockpot and then pour in the wine. Add enough water to cover the bones by 2 inches (about 4–6 quarts). 
3.  Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, and then immediately lower the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for at least 12 and up to 18 hours, adding water as necessary to keep the bones submerged.
4.  Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and then use a wide-mouthed funnel to pour it into four 1-quart jars, sealing their lids tightly. Cook with the broth right away or place the jars in the refrigerator to allow the fat to harden.
5.  Alternatively, you can freeze the broth for up to 6 months, making sure to allow plenty of head-space if you’re using glass jars. Be sure to spoon off the hard layer of fat before cooking with the broth. You can reserve this fat to cook with, or discard it as it suits you.

## Notes

When we order our beef, once a year, straight from a nearby rancher who raises his steers on grassy range land, we make sure to order soup bones. We also ask the butcher to reserve knuckles and cartilage-rich cuts of bone that he might normally discard. A combination of meaty neck bones, fatty marrow bones, and joints work well to create a broth that is at once flavorsome, luxuriant, and silky in texture, producing a solid, bouncing gel when cooled.
