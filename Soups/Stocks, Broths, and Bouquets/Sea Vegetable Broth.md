## From Jennifer McGruthe’s Broth & Stock from the Nourished Kitchen

---

## Ingredients

* 6 green onions, chopped into 1-inch pieces
* 2 celery stalks, chopped into 1-inch pieces
* 1 carrot, chopped into 1-inch pieces
* 1 (6-inch) strip kombu
* 1 leaf dried dulse
* 8 dried shiitakes
* 2–3 quarts cold water or Whole Chicken Broth

## Steps

1.  Drop the onions, celery, and carrot into a heavy stockpot. Check the kombu and dulse leaves for any stray shells or debris that might adhere to them, and then add them to the pot with the veggies. 
2.  Add the shiitakes to the pot, pour in the water, and bring to a bare simmer over medium-high heat. Turn down the heat to medium and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.
3.  Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve, then use a wide-mouthed funnel to pour it into two 1-quart jars, sealing the lids tightly. Cook with the broth right away or store it in the refrigerator for no more than 5 days. Alternatively, you can freeze the broth for up to 6 months, making sure to allow plenty of head-space if you’re using glass jars.

## Notes

Sea vegetables are among my favorite foods and are extraordinarily rich in minerals, particularly iodine, which helps support thyroid health. Dried seaweed is available for purchase in many natural foods stores. Kombu comes in long, thick, brittle strips that soften readily in warm water. Dulse, by contrast, is leafy and thin, breaking easily into flakes, which is how it is often sold. For this recipe, purchase dried dulse leafs, not dulse flakes, which will filter through your sieve when you try to strain your broth.
