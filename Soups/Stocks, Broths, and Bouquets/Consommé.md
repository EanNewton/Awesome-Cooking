## Steps

1.  Make the raft by running the onion, carrot, celery, mushrooms, and duck meat through a meat grinder, or by pulsing in a food processor until you have a rough mash. Don’t puree it.
2.  Mix in the garlic, egg whites, rosemary, sage, and bay leaves and chill for at least 4 hours, or up to overnight.
3.  Pour the cold duck brother into a stockpot and add the salt.
4.  Mix the tomato puree with the raft and add to the stock. Turn heat to medium and bring slowly to a simmer. Do not let it boil under any circumstances or you will ruin your consomme. Stir every couple minutes until the raft begins to float on the surface.
5.  When the raft has formed, poke a 1 inch hole in its center and let the consomme simmer gently for 1 hour to 1 and a half hours. If using fish stock, no more than 45 minutes.
6.  Put a fine meshed sieve over a container large enough to hold the consomme and line the sieve with a paper towel or several layers of cheesecloth. Turn the heat to low on the consomme and ladle the soup through the sieve into the container. When you get to the bottom of the stockpot, pick out the raft and discard, then pour the remaining consomme through the sieve.
7.  Chill the consomme or serve immediately. Add salt to taste before serving. Store in the fridge for up to 10 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
