# Fish Stock

## From Jennifer McGruthe’s Broth & Stock from the Nourished Kitchen

## Ingredients

* 5 lb fish trimmings, such as the bones and head
* 1 cup dry white wine
* 4–6 quarts cold water


---

## Steps

1.  Drop the fish trimmings into a heavy stockpot and then pour in the wine. Cover with cold water by 1 inch (about 4–6 quarts) and then slowly bring the broth to a bare simmer over medium heat. Skim off and discard any foam or scum that rises to the surface of the stock and discard. Simmer the stock for about 25 minutes, or until fragrant but not overpowering.
2.  Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve and use it right away or store it in four 1-quart sized jars, sealing their lids tightly, for no more than 5 days. Alternatively you can freeze the stock for up to 6 months, making sure to allow plenty of head-space if you’re using glass jars.

## Notes

* Fish are delicate creatures and do not withstand prolonged cooking well. Heat can damage their fragile polyunsaturated fatty acids, leaving the stock with an overly fishy off-flavor. Their thin and almost translucent bones don’t need as much coaxing to release their nutrients as beef bones do, and so just a short while in the pot, less than an hour, is sufficient to give you a good, nutritive fish stock.
* When making fish stock, it’s best to avoid oily fish like salmon, mackerel, Arctic char, and sardines, as their fragile oils can break down easily with the prolonged exposure to heat required in making stock, leaving an unpleasant flavor. Instead, choose the frames of non-oily fish like cod, plaice, haddock, snapper, or catfish to make your stock, as they’ll impart a better flavor.
* If you don’t fish yourself, you can purchase whole fish or fish trimmings. Fishmongers and natural foods markets with fish counters will often sell you the bones and heads at very affordable rates or give them to you if you ask.
