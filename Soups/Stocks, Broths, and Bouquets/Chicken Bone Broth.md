# Chicken Bone Broth

## From Jennifer McGruthe’s Broth & Stock from the Nourished Kitchen

## Ingredients

* The spent frame of 1 roasted chicken
* ½ cup dry white wine
* 4–6 quarts cold water


---

## Steps

1.  Drop the bones in a stockpot, add the wine and then cover the bones with water by about 1-inch (4-6 quarts). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then immediately turn down to medium-low, and simmer, covered, for at least 8 and up to 18 hours, or until the broth is rich and fragrant and the bones crumble when you press them between your thumb and forefinger. Skim off any foam that rises to the top of the stockpot as necessary. Reserve the foam for Russian Chicken Skim Broth or discard it.
2.  Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and then use a wide-mouthed funnel to pour it into four 1-quart jars, sealing their lids tightly. Cook with the broth right away or place the jars in the refrigerator for up to one week. Alternatively you can freeze the broth for up to 6 months, making sure to allow plenty of head-space if you’re using glass jars. 
3.  When you’re ready to serve the broth, you’ll notice a thin layer of semisolid yellow fat at the top of the jar. Spoon off this fat and use the broth as you would normally. You can reserve the fat to use as you would any cooking fat or try it in Schmaltz Mashed Potatoes and Gravy with Black Pepper and Fresh Thyme.

## Notes

I plunk the bones of a roasted chicken into my stockpot about once a week where it simmers away for hours, producing a beautiful, rich golden broth with deep savory notes marked by hints of caramel. Clear and delicate, it’s nice sipped on its own or used as a base for soups dotted with vegetables and fortified by grains or starchy potatoes.
