# Chicken Foot Stock

## From Jennifer McGruthe’s Broth & Stock from the Nourished Kitchen

---

## Ingredients

* 3 pounds prepared chicken feet
* ¼ cup white wine
* 4–6 quarts cold water


---

## Steps

1.  Place the chicken feet into a heavy stockpot, pour in the wine, and add enough cold water to cover the chicken feet by 1 inch (about 4–6 quarts). Cover the pot, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and then immediately turn down the heat to medium-low. Keep the feet at a bare simmer, uncovered, for at least 8 and up to 12 hours, adding water as necessary to keep the feet submerged. Skim off any foam that appears on the surface of the broth and discard it.
2.  Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard the spent feet, as you won’t need them after you’ve made the stock.
3.  Use the stock right away or transfer into four 1-quart sized jars, sealing their lids tightly. Alternatively, you can freeze the stock for up to 6 months, making sure to allow plenty of head-space if you’re using glass jars.
4.  A thin layer of yellow fat may rise to the surface of your refrigerated or frozen stock and harden; spoon off and discard the fat before cooking with the stock. Unlike the fat rendered from bone broths and other stocks, the fat rendered from chicken feet doesn’t lend itself well to other uses in the kitchen.

## Notes

Chicken feet are, perhaps, the last frontier for the broth maker. Unlike the neat plastic wrapped packages of boneless, skinless chicken breasts you find in the grocery store, chicken feet are decidedly and unrepentantly animalistic. If they make you squeamish, I don’t blame you. If you can transcend their ick factor long enough to drop chicken feet into a stockpot, you’ll reap the rewards in a resolutely flavor-rich, silky stock, dense with gelatin.
