# Whole Chicken Broth

## From Jennifer McGruthe’s Broth & Stock from the Nourished Kitchen

## Ingredients

* 1 whole chicken, 3 to 5 pounds
* 2 prepared chicken feet, if available
* ¼ cup dry white wine
* 4–6 quarts cold water


---

## Steps

1.  Place the chicken in a large stockpot, toss in the prepared feet, and then pour in the wine. Pour in enough water to cover the bird by 1 inch (about 4–6 quarts). Cover the pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Immediately lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for at least 4 and up to 6 hours, until the chicken meat is tender and separates easily from the bones.
2.  Using a broth skimmer or mesh spoon, skim off and discard any foam that appears on the surface of the broth as it simmers (or reserve for Russian Chicken Skim Broth). Turn off the heat. Gently remove the bird from the broth and allow it to cool until you can handle it comfortably. Carefully pick the meat off the bones. Place the meat in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. 
3.  Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and then use a wide-mouthed funnel to pour it into four 1-quart sized jars, sealing their lids tightly. 
Cook with the broth right away or store it in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Alternatively, you can freeze the broth for up to 6 months, making sure to allow plenty of headspace if you’re using glass jars.
When you’re ready to use your broth, spoon off any hardened fat at the top of the jar. You can reserve this fat to cook with, or discard it as it suits you.

## Notes

A pale, straw-colored broth with a pronounced chicken flavor, whole chicken broth tastes of comfort. I like to use it as a base for brothy soups dotted with greens and fresh vegetables. It’s also a wonderful time-saver because in addition to several quarts of broth, it also makes several cups of shredded, cooked chicken meat. You can add it to soups and casseroles or even make chicken salad with it.
