# Long-Simmered Roasted Pork Bone Broth

## From Jennifer McGruthe’s Broth & Stock from the Nourished Kitchen

---

## Ingredients

* 5 lb pork bones, such as neck bones and trotters
* 1 cup red wine
* 4–6 quarts cold water


---

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 425°F.
2.  Place the bones in a single layer in a roasting pan and roast in the heated oven for 45 minutes, or until they render a bit of fat and their edges begin to caramelize a little. 
3.  Transfer the bones to a heavy stockpot and then pour in the wine. Add enough water to cover the bones by 2 inches (about 4–6 quarts). 
4.  Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, and then immediately lower the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for at least 8 and up to 16 hours, adding water as necessary to keep the bones submerged.
5.  Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and then use a wide-mouthed funnel to pour it into four 1-quart jars, sealing their lids tightly. Cook with the broth right away or place the jars in the refrigerator to allow the fat to harden.
6.  Alternatively, you can freeze the broth for up to 6 months, making sure to allow plenty of head-space if you’re using glass jars. Be sure to spoon off the hard layer of fat before cooking with the broth. You can reserve this fat to cook with, or discard it as it suits you.

## Notes

* Where chicken bone broths are light, and beef bone broths are assertive, pork broth falls somewhere in between. Depending on the breed of the pig, your pork bones may render a great deal of fat or very little. Heritage breeds, like Mangalitsa, tend to produce more fat than modern breeds. You can spoon off the fat that rises to the surface of your broth as it cools and use it just as you might any other cooking fat, though it is particularly nice for sautéing onions or in biscuits and piecrust.
* Take care not to choose smoked pork hock or ham hocks for a basic broth like this, as they will impart their smoky flavor into the liquid, which may or may not benefit your final dish. Instead, use smoked pork hock or ham hocks in dishes like Galician Pork and Bean Stew with Greens or Pinto Beans and Ham Hock.
