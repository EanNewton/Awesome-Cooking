## Steps

1.  You can find chicken feet at many ethnic grocers, health food stores, and even at farmers’ markets and farm stands if you request them ahead of time so your rancher knows to save them at the time she culls her flock. For the most part, when you purchase chicken feet, they will already be prepared, but if not here is how I prepare them at home. 
2.  A thin, papery yellow membrane adheres to chicken feet. When left on the feet, and in the stockpot, it can create more scum that you’ll need to skim and even introduce off-flavors to the stock, so it’s best to remove the membrane. Working with feet that have been frozen first helps you to remove that membrane more easily. 
3.  To prepare chicken feet, bring a pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat. While the water comes to a boil, prepare an ice bath by dumping a few cupfuls of ice into a large mixing bowl and filling it half full with cold water.
4.  To prevent crowding and overcooking, drop one chicken foot at a time into the boiling water. Leave it in for a second or two, then transfer it to the ice bath with tongs. Continue this process until you’ve put all of the chicken feet in the ice bath. 
5.  Just as the skin of a tomato or peach will separate easily from the fruit when first put into boiling water and then into ice water, so too will the membrane on the chicken foot loosen. Take the chicken feet from the ice water and gently pull away the membrane from each foot and discard it. 
6.  Now, lay each foot on a sturdy cutting board and chop off each talon at the first joint with a sharp knife. This practice helps you to keep a clearer broth. Once you’ve removed the membranes and talons, your chicken feet are ready for the stockpot.
