# Dashi

## From Jennifer McGruthe’s Broth & Stock from the Nourished Kitchen

---

## Ingredients

* 4 cups cold water
* 1 (6-inch) strip kombu
* 1 cup bonito flakes


---

## Steps

1.  Fill a saucepan with the water and drop in a strip of kombu. Bring to a bare simmer over medium-high heat and then pluck out the kombu with a pair of tongs and discard it. Stir the bonito flakes into the hot water. Turn off the heat and cover the pot. Let the pot sit undisturbed until all of the bonito flakes sink to the bottom of the saucepan, about 10 minutes. 
2.  Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding the solids. Use the dashi immediately, or pour it into a 1-quart jar with a tight-fitting lid and store it in the fridge for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 6 months, making sure to allow plenty of head-space if you’re using glass jars.

## Notes

* A traditional base for soups in Japan, dashi is made from seaweed and bonito flakes, or shaved flakes of dried skipjack tuna, which you can find at many supermarkets and health foods stores as well as Asian markets. Mild in flavor, dashi makes for a clear broth with faint, subtle notes of smoke and fish.
* I like to keep dashi on hand, tucked in the back of my fridge, so that I can pull it out at any moment and make a fast miso soup or use it to braise vegetables like the Miso-Glazed Bok Choy.
