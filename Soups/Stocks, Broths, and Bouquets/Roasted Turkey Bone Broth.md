## From Jennifer McGruthe’s Broth & Stock from the Nourished Kitchen

## Ingredients

* The spent frame of 1 roasted turkey
* 4 carrots, sliced 1 inch thick
* 6 celery stalks, sliced 1 inch thick
* 1 large yellow onion, quartered and unpeeled
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tbsp whole black peppercorns
* ½ cup dry white wine
* 4–6 quarts cold water

## Steps

1.  Place the turkey bones into a large stockpot and then add the carrots and celery. Arrange the onion in the pot with the turkey bones and vegetables. Toss in the bay leaves and peppercorns and then pour in the wine and water. Bring it all to a boil over medium-high heat, and then immediately lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for at least 14 and up to 24 hours, until the bones crumble when crushed. Skim off and discard any foam that rises to the top of the stockpot as necessary.
2.  Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve, and then use a wide-mouthed funnel to pour it into four 1–quart jars, sealing their lids tightly. Cook with the broth right away or store it in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Alternatively, you can freeze the broth for up to 6 months, making sure to allow plenty of head-space if you’re using glass jars. 
3.  When you’re ready to serve the broth, you’ll notice a thin layer of semisolid yellow fat at the top of the jar. Spoon off the fat, which you can reserve and use to sauté or roast vegetables, or discard it, then use the broth as a base for turkey gravy or in Turkey Soup with Root Vegetables and Wild Rice.

## Notes

Each spring we reserve a turkey, or sometimes two, from a farmer. We visit her farm to pick up our weekly share of vegetables, and we always take the time to visit our turkey, too. It grows quickly at first, and then, just in time for Thanksgiving, it’s plump enough for the dinner table. I like to marinate it in a brine made of sweet apple cider, salt, sugar, and spices for a few days, before slow-roasting it overnight. We serve it to our hungry guests, and after we’ve picked as much meat off the bones as we can, I toss the turkey’s bones into the soup pot with aromatic vegetables, bay leaves, and black pepper to make a rich, golden-colored bone broth that serves as a base for soups that will nourish us for a week after Thanksgiving.
