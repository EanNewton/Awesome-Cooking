## Steps

1.  Add the parsley, kale, watercress, celery, onions, and garlic to a stockpot. Pour in 2–3 quarts of water or chicken broth and drop the kombu into the pot. Bring the whole thing to a bare simmer over medium-high heat and continue cooking, covered, for 20 minutes, or until the liquid takes on a pale yellow-green hue.
2.  Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve, and then use a wide-mouthed funnel to pour it into two 1-quart jars, sealing the lids tightly. Cook with the broth right away or store it in the refrigerator for no more than 5 days. Alternatively, you can freeze the broth for up to 6 months, making sure to allow plenty of head-space if you’re using glass jars.

## Notes

Adding vegetables, particularly leafy greens, to broth infuses it with not only bright vegetal notes but also minerals. While you can make a basic vegetable stock with nothing more than vegetables and water, you can also substitute the whole chicken broth as a base instead of water. This combination results in a broth rich in flavor as well as in protein and minerals like calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and manganese. You can use any variety of kale you happen to find at the market or sprouting up in your garden for this recipe, including curly kale, purple kale, and Lacinato kale. This broth can be enjoyed plain, with a sprinkling of sea salt, or used as a base for soups where its vibrant, green, and almost grassy notes bring added complexity.
