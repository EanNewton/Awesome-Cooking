## From Jennifer McGruthe’s Broth & Stock from the Nourished Kitchen

## Ingredients

* 6 celery stalks, including leaves
* 3 carrots, including the carrot tops
* 1 yellow onion
* 1 whole stewing hen (3 to 4 pounds)
* 2 leeks, cleaned
* 3 whole cloves
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
* 6 egg yolks, beaten
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley
* 2 tablespoons chopped chives

## Steps

1.  Pluck the leaves from the celery and place them in a stockpot. Chop off the carrot tops and peel the carrots, dropping both the peelings and tops into the pot. Chop off the root and top ends of the onion and then peel it, tucking the onion trimmings into the pot. Mince the celery, carrots, and onions very finely and then place them in a mixing bowl.
2.  Rinse the chicken thoroughly and pat dry before adding it to the stockpot, covering it completely with cold water by about 2 inches.
3.  Pierce the leek with the cloves so that they remain stuck inside its tender stalk and place it in the stockpot alongside the stewing chicken.
4.  Slowly simmer until the chicken is completely cooked and tender to the bone, about 2 hours. Carefully remove the chicken from the pot and place it on a platter to allow it to cool until you can pick the meat off the bones comfortably.
5.  Strain the remaining broth through a fine-mesh sieve, into a pitcher or jar, discarding the solids. Wipe the pot clean with a kitchen towel.
6.  Melt the butter in a cast-iron skillet until it foams, toss the minced vegetables and fry until they become fragrant and tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a clean stock pot.
7.  Once the chicken has cooled, pick its meat off the bones (reserve the bones for Double-Cooked Stock). Mince the meat very finely. Stir the chicken into the vegetables and pour the strained broth back into the stock pot. Stir in the finely grated nutmeg, and then bring it all to a bare simmer over medium heat.
8.  Temper the beaten eggs by stirring a spoonful of broth into the eggs, then pouring the mixture of eggs and broth into the simmering soup. Gently stir in the heavy cream, parsley, and chives. Season with salt and pepper.
9.  Ladle into soup bowls and serve warm.

## Notes

* Growing up, all I knew of creamed soups is that they came from a red-and-white can that, when opened, would yield a bouncy gelatinous goop that served as the glue that bound the casseroles we would take to church potlucks. This soup is not one of those; rather, it’s a lovely, comforting blend of aromatic vegetables, butter, egg yolks, cream, fresh herbs, and chicken.
* This soup makes little waste, and in a home where every penny counts, it’s rather nice to eke out every bit of flavor and nourishment from what you have available to you. So, use up the celery leaves and the carrot tops, and you’ll find they give the soup a beautiful aromatic flavor that blends well with the soft and soothing flavor of chicken, cream, parsley and chives. 
* This soup may separate when stored, so it’s best eaten right away. Adapted from James Beard’s Fireside Cookbook.
