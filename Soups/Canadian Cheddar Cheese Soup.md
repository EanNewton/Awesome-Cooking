## Steps

1.  In a 4- or 5- quart Dutch oven, cook the bacon, stirring, over medium heat for about 5  minutes or until lightly browned.
2.  Add the red onion, celery , and butter and saute for about 5 minutes, or until the onion has softened.
3.  Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for about 4 minutes over medium heat. Whisk in the chicken stock and bring to a boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4.  Add the milk and continue to simmer for 15 minutes. Do not boil after you add the milk.
5.  Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese, Tabasco sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper until the cheese is melted and the soup is smooth. Stir in warm beer. If the soup is too thick, thin with some warm milk.
6.  Serve the soup hot, garnish with chopped scallions or chives.


## What to drink
Although a hearty Canadian ale works, Jackson-Triggs Merlot, Okanagan Valley complements the rich flavors.
