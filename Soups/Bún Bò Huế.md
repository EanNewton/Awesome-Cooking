## Steps

1.  First off, you'll need lots and lots of lemongrass. About 8 stalks should be sufficient. Half a dozen will go into the stock pot, save the other two to be finely minced and flavor the soup at the end.
2.  Smash the lemongrass to release the fragrance. I used a pestle but a meat tenderizer would work too. Don't go overboard because too much lemongrass will make your stock bitter.
3.  Bring a large pot of broth to a boil, add one onion, the bruised lemongrass stalks, a few cloves of garlic, a knob of ginger, 1/4 of a pineapple, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon fish sauce, and 1 tablespoon of fermented shrimp paste.
4.  Then turn your heat down to medium-low and let simmer for at least 3 hours. Skim any foam or scum that rises to the surface.
5.  Finely slice two stalks of lemongrass. Then finely mince them in the food processor and set aside.
6.  In a pan on medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon annatto seeds. When the oil turns red and all color seems to have seeped from the seeds, remove the seeds. Add the 2 finely minced stalks of lemongrass and saute for a minute or so to release the fragrance. Then add 2 tablespoons of fermented shrimp paste and 1 tablespoon of chili sauce. Saute until smooth and then add the whole mixture to the stock pot.
7.  Time to prepare the garnish platter. Select a good-sized banana blossom. Even if you don't eat it all, select the biggest one you can find. The bigger the blossom, the less bitter it tastes. Thinly slice the banana blossoms and let them soak in a bowl of heavily salted water to prevent them from browning and to remove some of the astringency. Drain before serving.
8.  Prepare your garnish platters of bean sprouts, mint, basil, Vietnamese coriander, lime wedges, red cabbage if you don't have banana blossoms, cilantro, and onions.
9.  Boil the noodles and drain. Serve immediately. 


## Notes

* Annatto seeds are what makes bun bo Hue broth red.
* For the noodles I prefer Three Ladies brand Jiangxi bun giang tay. They come bundled into individual servings. One bag has four bundles and costs 49 cents.
