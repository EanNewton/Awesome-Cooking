## Steps

1.  In a medium soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, lemongrass, ginger, jalapenos, and garlic and cook until the onion is translucent and the garlic and ginger have softened, about 2 minutes.
2.  Mix in the broth, coconut milk, and honey. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce to simmer and cook, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
3.  Add the bean sprouts, cilantro, and lime zest and juice. Cook for 2 minutes to marry the flavors. Serve hot.
