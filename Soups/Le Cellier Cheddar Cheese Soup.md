## Steps

1.  Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions, celery and carrots and cook until the onion is translucent.
2.  Sprinkle in flour and stir constantly for 2 minutes. Stir in milk and stock, a little at a time, blending well to ensure there are no lumps. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
3.  Remove from heat and whisk in cheese, Tabasco, Worcestershire and ale. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4.  Serve with your favorite bread and top with chopped chives.

## Notes
* This recipe is missing something versus the original I tasted at Le Cellier, I have yet to figure out what precisely though.
* Feel free to use whatever cheese or mix of you prefer, I encourage you to experiment.
