## Ingredients

* 1 leek, root end and tough green parts reserved
* 2 sprigs thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon finely ground sea salt
* ½ teaspoon finely ground white pepper
* 1 small celeriac, chopped
* ¾ pound red potatoes, peeled and chopped
* 4 cups Sea Vegetable Broth
* ¾ pound wild-caught skinless Alaskan salmon fillets, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1 ounce dulse, picked over
* 1 cup heavy cream

## Steps

1.  Tuck the root and leek greens into a 100% cotton muslin bag or tie them together in cheesecloth with the thyme, bay leaves, and black peppercorns.
2.  Slice the white and light green part of the leek in half lengthwise and then slice it crosswise into half-moons about ¼ inch thick.
3.  Warm the butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat. When the butter melts and begins to foam, stir in the sliced leek. Turn the heat down to medium-low and then sprinkle with the salt and white pepper. Cover the pot and let the leek sweat until fragrant and tender, about 8 minutes.
4.  Stir the celeriac and potatoes into the softened leeks and then pour in the broth. Drop the sachet of herbs you prepared earlier in as well and then cover the pot and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are barely tender.
5.  Add the salmon and dulse and continue cooking, covered, for 10 minutes more, taking care not to disturb the pot as it cooks.
6.  Turn off the heat and remove the sachet. Season to taste with sea salt, stir in the heavy cream, and serve warm.

## Notes

A dark green, leafy seaweed with a briny and faintly sweet flavor, dulse makes a frequent appearance in traditional Irish cooking. Combined with salmon, cream, and potatoes, it creates a delicious chowder that’s substantial enough to serve as a full meal. Dulse provides a dose of minerals and iodine, a nutrient that supports thyroid health. I favor using the Sea Vegetable Broth in this recipe, instead of a seafood based stock. Mild in flavor and utterly creamy, this chowder is a favorite on our dinner table, always served with a crusty loaf of whole-grain sourdough bread.
