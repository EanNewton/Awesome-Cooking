* 1 cup sugar
* 2 ½ teaspoons soy sauce
* ½ teaspoon coarse salt, or ¼ teaspoon fine table salt

## Steps

1.  Gently rinse the soybeans under cold water a few times. 1. The skin is very fragile, so try not to damage it. Discard any damaged beans. Drain well.
2. Put the beans in an Instant Pot or pressure cooker, add water and soak as per package instructions, usually between 4 hours and overnight. Optionally, for a darker color, add a pickling iron or 2-3 cleaned rusty nails; remove after soaking.
3. Add sugar, soy, and salt and mix well.
4. Close the lid and set for high pressure for 15 minutes. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. The float valve goes up when pressurized.
5. Allow pressure to vent naturally after 15 minutes. Pour into a large airtight container and allow to cool uncovered. They are ready to serve at this point but for a more intense color allow to soak overnight in the refrigerator. Keep in the fridge for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 1 month. The excess beans and liquid can be used for pound cakes, black soybean lattes, or similar.
