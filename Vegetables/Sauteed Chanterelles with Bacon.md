## Steps

1.  Heat a 12‚Äù skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and fry until crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain; set aside.
2. Add butter; cook until milky foam settles at the bottom of the skillet and turns nut brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
3. Increase heat to medium-high and add mushrooms and garlic; cook until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
4. Sprinkle it with parsley, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Garnish with reserved bacon.


## Notes
The easiest way to clean chanterelles is with a toothbrush.
