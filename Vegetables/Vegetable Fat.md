## Steps

1.  Using a heavy bottomed pot add canola oil and garlic, cook over low heat until garlic is beyond tender but do not allow caramelization.
2.  Remove from heat and strain garlic. Reserve garlic for another use.
3.  Allow oil to cool then add remaining ingredients. Use an immersion blender to disperse dry ingredients. Allow to sit for 24 hours before use. Contents will settle so stir well before using.
