## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 400 F. Place kabocha and delicata squash on separate large rimmed baking sheets. Drizzle with oil; season with salt and pepper. Roast, tossing occasionally, until squashes are golden brown and tender, about 30 to 35 minutes for kabocha and 20 to 25 minutes for delicata.
1. Meanwhile, bring chiles, vinegar, honey, raisins, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer until syrupy, about 8 to 10 minutes.
2. Brush half of warm agrodolce over warm squash. Transfer to a platter.
3. Just before serving, reheat remaining agrodolce, adding a splash of water if needed to loosen. Spoon over squash.
