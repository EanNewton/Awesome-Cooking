* 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, roasted

## Steps

1.  Husk the corn and boil in plenty of salted water with the pandanus leaves until tender, about 10 minutes. It could take longer, depending on the quality and freshness of the corn. When ready, take out and allow to cool before paring off the kernels.
2.  Mix the coconut with the salt, then stir into the corn. Lightly crush the sesame seeds, mix with the sugar and sprinkle over the corn and coconut.
