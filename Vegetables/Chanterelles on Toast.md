## Steps

1.  Heat a large fry pan over medium-high heat, and when it is hot add the olive oil. Once the olive oil is hot and shimmering, but not smoking, add the chanterelles. Cook for 4 minutes without moving them around too much.
2. Add the sherry vinegar and the lemon juice and cook down until fully reduced.
3. Add the stock and reduce by half (you are not exactly reducing so much as hydrating the mushrooms). Add the rosemary, thyme, parsley, and butter. Stir with a wooden spoon to incorporate the butter.
4. Season with salt and pepper and serve over toasted bread with shaved Parmesan.


## Notes
The easiest way to clean chanterelles is with a toothbrush.
