## Steps

### Make the potatoes: 

1. Drop the potatoes into a large stockpot and cover them with water by 2 inches. Stir in the salt and bring the potatoes to a boil over high heat. Boil, covered, until the potatoes soften and become tender, about 30 minutes.

### Make the gravy: 

1. While the potatoes cook, pour the broth into a saucepan over medium heat. As the broth warms, blend the schmaltz and flour together in a small bowl with the back of a fork or a pastry blender until it forms a paste.
2. When you see the tiniest of bubbles appear on the sides of the saucepan, drop about 1 teaspoon of the schmaltz paste into the broth. Whisk it furiously into the broth until no lumps remain and then continue working the paste into the broth about 1 teaspoon at a time until you’ve used it all. Continue whisking the gravy until thickened to your liking.
3. Stir in the thyme and black pepper and season with salt. Turn down the temperature to its lowest setting and keep the gravy warm while you finish the potatoes.
4. Once the potatoes are tender, drain them, and then transfer them to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Spoon in the schmaltz and beat until it melts and absorbs into the potatoes. Beat the broth into the potatoes a few tablespoons at a time until the potatoes fully absorb the broth and whip them together until smooth, with no lumps remaining. Season with salt and pepper as you like it.
5. Spoon the potatoes into a serving bowl and serve them with the gravy.


## Notes

* There is something inherently comforting about curling up to a bowl of mashed potatoes swimming in toffee-colored, salty gravy. Schmaltz, soft and pale yellow, is rendered chicken fat, popular in traditional Ashkenazi Jewish cooking. It offers a delicate but pronounced chicken flavor, and owing to its high monounsaturated fat content, it makes an excellent and versatile cooking fat. Its flavor pairs well with other neutral ingredients like potatoes, offering a lovely alternative to butter.
* You can buy rendered schmaltz in some specialty grocery stores as well as online, or you can simply spoon the fat that rises to the top of your homemade chicken stock into a jar in your refrigerator, where it will harden, and save it for this recipe.
