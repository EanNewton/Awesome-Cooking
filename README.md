# About

If this is your first time cooking from these recipes I would suggest the following menu, feel free to mix it up though: 

* [Lemon Basil Roast Chicken](https://github.com/EanNewton/Awesome-Cooking/blob/master/Meat/Lemon%20Basil%20Roast%20Chicken.md)
* [Roast Potatoes](https://github.com/EanNewton/Awesome-Cooking/blob/master/Vegetables/Roast%20Potatoes.md)
* [Cranberry-Avocado Salad with White Balsamic Vinaigrette](https://github.com/EanNewton/Awesome-Cooking/blob/master/Vegetables/Salads/Cranberry-Avocado%20Salad%20with%20White%20Balsamic%20Vinaigrette.md)
* [Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies](https://github.com/EanNewton/Awesome-Cooking/blob/master/Baking%20%26%20Sweets/Chewy%20Chocolate%20Chip%20Cookies.md)

The above recipes are more or less foolproof, don‚Äôt require any unusual ingredients / equipment or techniques, and are general crowd-pleasers for the American palate. Make sure to use the leftover chicken frame to make a broth or soup.

I have tried to include a diverse mix of regions, complexities, techniques, and flavors. Many of these recipes can feed into each other, for example you can make the [Lemon Basil Roast Chicken](https://github.com/EanNewton/Awesome-Cooking/blob/master/Meat/Lemon%20Basil%20Roast%20Chicken.md) one day, turn it into [Whole Chicken Broth](https://github.com/EanNewton/Awesome-Cooking/blob/master/Soups/Stocks%2C%20Broths%2C%20and%20Bouquets/Whole%20Chicken%20Broth.md) overnight, and then make the [Coconut and Lemongrass Soup](https://github.com/EanNewton/Awesome-Cooking/blob/master/Soups/Coconut%20%26%20Lemongrass%20Soup.md) from the leftover meat and broth the next day; or throw the meat into a salad, or perhaps make sandwiches with the [Hot Buttered Pretzels](https://github.com/EanNewton/Awesome-Cooking/blob/master/Baking%20%26%20Sweets/Hot%20Buttered%20Pretzels.md). Some of the dishes and their ingredients may sound strange but don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment with them, be brave. Likewise, if an ingredient is unavailable, not available in a good quality, or prohibitively expensive then get creative or try a different recipe. 

Always use quality ingredients, work at a comfortable pace, and clean as you go. Everything presented here is aimed at a few goals: connecting people with food and its origin, that being the earth and those who produce goods from it; connecting people with each other, food should be shared and enjoyed, life is short so eat well, eat plenty, and smile more, perhaps with a drink in hand to share a toast; and of course, how does it taste?
