# Bill's Buttermilk Vanilla Milkshake

---

## Ingredients

* 6 to 8 large scoops good vanilla ice cream
* 2/3 cup buttermilk, or a bit more, depending on how thick you like your milkshake
* A scant 1/4 cup whole milk (optional)

---

## Steps

1.  If you can wait, let your ice cream soften up a bit. In a large bowl or pitcher, mix with a wooden spoon.
2.  You can also use a blender on low speed for this, but be careful not to overmix. If it is too thick for your taste, add more buttermilk. Or if you don't want more tang, a little milk is fine too.
3.  Pour, serve, enjoy.
