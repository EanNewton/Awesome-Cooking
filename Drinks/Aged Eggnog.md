## Ingredients

* 12 large eggs / 600 g, pasteurized if you need peace of mind
* 1 lb / 454 g sugar
* 1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
* 1 pint / 480 ml half and half
* 1 pint / 473 ml whole milk
* 1 pint / 480 ml heavy cream
* 1 cup / 237 ml Jamaican rum
* 1 cup / 237 ml cognac
* 1 cup / 237 ml bourbon
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt

## Steps

1.  Separate the eggs and store the whites for another application.
2.  Beat the yolks with the sugar and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl until the mixture lightens in color and falls off the whisk in solid a ribbon.
3.  Combine the dairy, booze, and salt in a second large bowl or pitcher and then slowly beat into the egg mixture.
4.  Move to a large glass jar (or a couple of smaller ones) and store in the fridge for a minimum of 2 weeks. A month would be better, and 2 better still. In fact, there's nothing that says you couldn't age it a year, but I've just never been able to wait that long. And yes, you can also drink it right away.
5.  Serve in mugs or cups topped with a little extra nutmeg grated on top.
