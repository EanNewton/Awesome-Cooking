# Wicked Good Burgers

## Special Burger Blends

* 1 pound (455 g) freshly ground chuck
* 1⁄2 pound (225 g) total weight of one or more of the
following:
    *	Short ribs — This gives burgers extra fat and
    intense beefy flavor; it’s a good choice if you will
    be cooking the burgers beyond Medium-rare.
    *	Brisket — This adds tangy, earthy flavor.
    Use the point for more fat, which makes the
    burgers juicier.
    *	Dry-aged strip steak — This special cut adds a
    musky, concentrated beef flavor.
    *	Beef cheeks — These are lean and tough, but if
    they are cooked for a long time they become
    incredibly tender. When ground with chuck for
    burgers, they make the blend rich and unctuous.
    *	Skirt steak — This adds meaty texture and is a
    beef lover’s favorite
* You can also add 1⁄4 pound (115 g) of one of the
following. If you opt to do this, reduce the chuck
by 1⁄4 pound (115 g).
    *	Beef Marrow — This gives burgers a rich, intense
    umami bomb. Your guests will be agog at your
    burger prowess.
    *	Pork fat — Do you like your burgers juicy? Get
    ready for a gusher.
    *	Bacon — For smoky, peppery burgers, add a few
    strips of sliced, uncooked bacon
